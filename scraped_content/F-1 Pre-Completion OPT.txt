 Students Studying in The United States Applying for Pre Completion OPT 

 F 1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS for Pre Completion Optional Practical Training OPT work authorization which allows actively enrolled students to gain relevant work experience within their field of study 











 Overview 

Optional Practical Training OPT is an employment authorization benefit for F 1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their major field of study It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his her program of study Students may engage in Pre Completion OPT or Pre OPT while actively enrolled in an academic program To request Pre OPT work authorization students must 

Request a Pre OPT Recommendation in their SEVIS record from the Office of Global Services Submit an application to U S Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS for review and adjudication

Students are eligible for a total of 12 months of Optional Practical Training OPT at each degree level This means that any time for which a student receives Pre OPT authorization will be subtracted from the time available for Post Completion OPT Note Pre OPT work authorization is only available to students when they are actively enrolled at Northeastern In order to request work authorization post graduation students must submit an application for Post Completion OPT 



 Eligibility 

A Bachelor s or Master s degree student may be eligible to apply for Pre OPT prior to completion of studies both during the academic year and during the annual vacation period PhD students may be eligible to apply for Pre OPT any time during the program of study if all course work other than the thesis dissertation has been completed To apply for Pre OPT all of the following criteria must be met 

Student has maintained valid F 1 student status Student has studied full time in the U S for at least 1 academic year

Time spent in language training and non degree programs does not count toward the one academic year requirement

 Student has not exceeded 364 days of full time Curricular Practical Training CPT at the current degree level Student has not previously engaged in 12 months of full time Pre or Post OPT at the current degree level Student has registered for a full time courseload with appropriate on ground presence during the entire period of requested Pre OPT

This does not apply if the requested Pre OPT will take place during the annual vacation period







 Full time vs Part time Pre OPT 

A student may be eligible to apply for part time less than 20 hours per week or full time more than 20 hours per week Pre OPT Please see below for eligibility requirements for both options Part Time Pre OPT 20 or less hours week 

During an academic term During annual vacation and other official school breaks

Full Time Pre OPT more than 20 hours week 

During annual vacation and other official school breaks For PhD students who have completed all coursework except thesis dissertation NOTE full time pre OPT is NOT allowed during required academic terms except for certain PhD students as mentioned in the bullet above





 Special Considerations for PhD students 

If a PhD student has completed all coursework but is in the final stages of thesis dissertation immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre Completion OPT or Post Completion OPT while completing the thesis dissertation In this case the PhD student and his her college need to determine the program completion date which will be reflected on the I 20 If you choose to apply for Post Completion OPT while completing your thesis dissertation 

You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post OPT The days you do not have a job count towards your 90 days of unemployment time You cannot request a program extension even if your thesis dissertation is not completed after Post OPT is expired

Note If you are a student with Stipended Graduate Assistantship SGA you must discuss with your department to determine when your SGA will end The SGA cannot extend beyond the end date as listed on your I 20

 We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS 

Once you have assembled your Pre OPT I 20 and all other required documents into a packet you must send it to the USCIS address below However it is always best practice to confirm the most up to date USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I 765 directly on the USCIS website It is recommended you mail your OPT packet through certified mail which includes a tracking number and guaranteed delivery date Effective 01 08 2021 you will mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox For U S Postal Service deliveries Attn I 765 C03 P O Box 805373 Chicago IL 60680 5374 For courier service deliveries non U S Postal Service FedEx UPS and DHL USCIS Attn I 765 C03 Box 805373 131 South Dearborn 3rd Floor Chicago IL 60603 5517 eShipGlobal mailing option eShipGlobal offers a shipping service for international students sending their OPT applications to USCIS Students can choose their carrier UPS FedEx or USPS and type of delivery next day 2 day etc and ship at discounted rates This service is not a Northeastern University service All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly USCIS Processing Times

USCIS advertises normal processing time for OPT requests as being around 100 days You can check current processing times on USCIS s website

After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for Pre OPT you should receive a receipt notice Form I 797 from USCIS 



 What Happens After I Submit my Application to USCIS 

 You should receive a receipt notice Form I 797 from USCIS You can look up your case status online using the case number 

If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2 weeks If you submitted the G1145 form with your application you will be informed electronically by email and or text If you paid for your Pre OPT fee by personal check the back of the cashed check will have the number You may obtain a copy of this check from your bank You may contact the USCIS call center at 800 375 5283 

 Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your Pre OPT is approved expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD You must not work until you receive your EAD card and you may only work within the dates specified on the EAD card 

The EAD card not your approval notice is your work authorization documentation 



Note Your application will remain in pending status until a decision has been made on your application this may be a few months Adjudication of your application is completed by USCIS Therefore USCIS will inform you directly of the official receipt request for additional information and the decision on your application Please be aware that this is a normal processing timeframe and regrettably OGS is unable to assist in expediting any requests OGS is here to guide you if you receive any communication from USCIS that requires response request for additional information denial etc 



 Unemployment During Pre OPT 

There are no restrictions on unemployment during Pre OPT Students are not required to have a job offer to apply for Pre Completion OPT however it is advantageous to have prospective employment opportunities since any time authorized for Pre OPT is subtracted from the time available for Post OPT whether the student obtains employment or not 



 Important reminders 

 USCIS must receive the Pre OPT application within 30 days of the issued OPT recommendation by OGS if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days after the issuance of the OPT I 20 the application will be denied this is the most common reason for the denial of Pre OPT If your entire application is returned to you consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application your application may not be considered received and you may need a new I 20 with OPT recommendation Do not submit a Pre OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining an I 20 with the OPT recommendation Make sure that the address on your OPT application is valid for receiving mail at all times during OPT processing If you have a pending Pre OPT application and simultaneously apply for Post OPT OGS will deduct the amount of recommended Pre OPT time from the 12 months of Post OPT recommendation





 Travel While on Pre OPT 

During Pre OPT travel restrictions remain the same as they are during normal F 1 study You should carry the following documents when re entering the U S 

A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U S Unexpired F 1 visa I 20 with a valid travel signature travel signatures are valid for 1 year
