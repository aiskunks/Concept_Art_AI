 Frequently Asked Questions

 







 Am I able to get a program extension after my I 20 program end date has passed 



 No after your program end date has passed OGS is no longer able to extend your program If you believe that you will need a program extension please make sure that you apply with OGS well in advance Not extending before your program end date will result in you losing valid F or J status and require corrective action at considerable expense to a student and potential loss of F 1 or J 1 benefits
