 Frequently Asked Questions 



 Frequently Asked Questions

 







 Q Will a part time status on my tax form affect my PGWP 



 If the information on your tax form is incorrect then that is an issue to resolve with SFS If you were actually part time during a term then you may be required to explain this to IRCC on your PGWP application If you were part time during a regular academic term then your eligibility for the PGWP may be affected IRCC and CRA do not share information except for two situations 

There is an investigation due to suspected fraud You have applied for Canadian citizenship and IRCC needs to verify your residency and tax status to support your Citizenship application 

Your PGWP eligibility will be assessed on your enrolment records with the Registrar s Office and on the compliance report that we submit biannually to IRCC 







 Q How will co op be shown on my transcript Will this affect my PGWP application 



 Your co op will be indicated on your transcript in the appropriate term If you believe that your transcript doesn t properly represent what you were doing each term then be sure to include a letter of explanation with your PGWP application As an example if you took a part time course load while working on co op and your registration status for that term is showing as part time then include that information in your letter of explanation with your PGWP application 







 Q How are summer breaks shown on my letter of program completion or transcript 



 If your program has a summer break then this should be shown in the academic calendar for your program or if you have a modified program in your course or program map Studying part time or full time during a scheduled break in your program is fine and will not affect your PGWP Courses taken during breaks still need to be the majority on ground as your program is assessed overall including studies done during non mandatory terms 







 Q Can I get a letter explaining my enrolment status and showing summer breaks 



 You will receive a letter to verify that you have completed your program requirements to support your PGWP You will also need to obtain a transcript to submit with your PGWP application If you have taken a part time course load or an authorized leave or have another unique situation you would need to explain and document this in a letter of explanation with your PGWP application
