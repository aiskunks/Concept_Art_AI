Notes from the Office of Global Services
Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS  OGS is unable to assist students with the application process
Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time
OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost  We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS
