Administrative Processing   Visa Denials
Administrative Processing   Visa Refusals
Although most J 1 visa applications are approved  the outcome of some J 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g  or what is commonly referred to as  Administrative Processing   In these cases  the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information  or whether the case requires additional administrative processing  Please note that this is not a visa denial  Additionally  for J 1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields  your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing  This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time
You should follow the instructions on the 221 g  to provide any requested information or documentation  If the 221 g  requires any information directly from Northeastern  or if the 221 g  will delay your arrival to the U S  to start your J 1 program  please contact  email protected
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing
Visa Denials
Although J 1 visa denials are rare  the most common visa denial is under 214 b   which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent  and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country  family  job  education  property  that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S  and instead will return home after their J 1 program
The J 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions  and is typically not a document driven process  Therefore  when a J 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b   Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial
If your J 1 visa application is denied under 214 b   you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer  You can apply again for the J 1 visa  but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials
If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U S  to begin or continue your J 1 program  please email your Northeastern HR contact   faculty supervisor  and copy  email protected  to notify us that you will not be starting your program
