Visa Application Outcomes
Approval
Congratulations  The majority of F 1 visa applicants are approved  You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after  They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you
Denials
Although F 1 visa denials are rare  the most common visa denial is under 214 b   which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent  and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country  family  job  education  property  that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S  and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post completion OPT or STEM OPT
The F 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions and is typically not a document driven process  Therefore  when an F 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b   Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial
If your F 1 visa application is denied under 214 b   you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer  Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F 1 visa  but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials
Administrative Processing
The outcome of some F 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g  or what is commonly referred to as  Administrative Processing   Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months  In these cases  the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information  or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing  Please note that this is not a visa denial  You should follow the instructions listed on the 221 g  notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy
If the 221 g  requires any information directly from Northeastern  please contact OGS by calling  1 617 373 2310  You will be instructed to share the 221 g  notice with an OGS advisor for further review
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing
Expedited Visa Appointments
U S  Embassies Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F 1 visa interview date if your I 20 program start date is within 60 days  and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date
The process to request an expedited F 1 visa interview varies by location  You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview  or on their online appointment scheduling site  You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment  such as your I 20 showing a program start date within 60 days
Please note  You must first submit the online visa application form  DS 160   pay the application fee  and schedule the first available interview appointment  Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment
