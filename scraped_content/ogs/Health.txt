Student Health Care
To assure students in Massachusetts have access to health care and are protected against the potentially significant financial impact of an unexpected illness or accident  the Commonwealth of Massachusetts mandates all students participating in at least 75  of a full time course load in a degree seeking program must participate in their school s student health plan or in a health benefit program with comparable coverage that meets Qualifying Student Health Insurance Program standards
In accordance with Massachusetts regulations  you will automatically be enrolled in Northeastern University s health benefits program  NUSHP  each academic year  The cost of coverage will be included in your bill  You have the option to waive this coverage  but only if you provide proof that you are covered by a plan with comparable health benefits that also meets Massachusetts s regulations
The NUSHP healthcare program offers comprehensive benefits to students wherever they travel  work  or study  The NUSHP web pages explain the process for using the health care center and for emergency needs  Students with other health programs will receive a guide to services from those programs
Students studying in the U S  may not waive insurance based on coverage through insurance carriers owned and operated outside the U S  nor by coverage through foreign National Health Service programs  Students sponsored by foreign embassies  agencies  and organizations are not excluded from the requirement for U S  based health insurance
