Overview
Optional Practical Training  OPT  is an employment authorization benefit for F 1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their major field of study  It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his her program of study  Students may engage in Pre Completion OPT  or Pre OPT  while actively enrolled in an academic program  To request Pre OPT work authorization  students must
Request a Pre OPT Recommendation in their SEVIS record from the Office of Global Services
Submit an application to U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  for review and adjudication
Students are eligible for a total of 12 months of Optional Practical Training  OPT  at each degree level  This means that any time for which a student receives Pre OPT authorization will be subtracted from the time available for Post Completion OPT
Note  Pre OPT work authorization is only available to students when they are actively enrolled at Northeastern  In order to request work authorization post graduation  students must submit an application for Post Completion OPT
Eligibility
A Bachelor s or Master s degree student may be eligible to apply for Pre OPT prior to completion of studies both during the academic year and during the annual vacation period

NOTE  full time pre OPT is NOT allowed during required academic terms except for certain PhD students as mentioned in the bullet above
Special Considerations for PhD students
If a PhD student has completed all coursework but is in the final stages of thesis dissertation  immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre Completion OPT or Post Completion OPT while completing the thesis dissertation
In this case  the PhD student and his her college need to determine the program completion date  which will be reflected on the I 20
If you choose to apply for Post Completion OPT while completing your thesis dissertation
You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post OPT
The days you do not have a job count towards your 90 days of unemployment time
You cannot request a program extension even if your thesis dissertation is not completed after Post OPT is expired
Note  If you are a student with Stipended Graduate Assistantship  SGA   you must discuss with your department to determine when your SGA will end  The SGA cannot extend beyond the end date as listed on your I 20
