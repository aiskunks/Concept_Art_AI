Helping Students Engage with the World
The N U in program is an experiential  academic program that expands students  Northeastern education into worldwide locations  Because the first semester of the N U in program is spent outside the U S   international students must read all the information to understand how this will impact their arrival to the U S  when coming to the Boston campus in the spring term after the N U in program
I 20 Form for Spring Semester
The I 20 form is a visa eligibility document issued by Northeastern University to certify that an eligible international student has met admission requirements for a full time program of study and has demonstrated sufficient financial support for his her studies in the U S  This visa eligibility document is needed to apply for a nonimmigrant student visa at a U S  Embassy or U S  Consulate in order to obtain F 1 status within the U S
NOTE  For students who are participating in N U in outside the United States  the I 20 lists your January program start date  You can enter the U S  as an F 1 student up to 30 days before this date
Canadian and Bermudian citizens typically do not need visas to study in the U S  However  you do need to request an I 20 and also pay the SEVIS fee

International students participating in the N U in program outside of the U S  are not eligible for SEVIS transfer from previous institutions because the difference between the end of their high school program and the beginning of their U S  portion of the N U in Program is more than five months
Please do not ask your high school to transfer your SEVIS record to Northeastern if you are participating in N U in outside of the U S  Your I 20 from Northeastern will be a new  initial  I 20 with a new SEVIS number  which means that you will need to pay another SEVIS fee and apply for a new F 1 visa
Applying for the I 20
You can submit an initial I 20 request only after you have been admitted to a program at Northeastern University  For many students  this means that you will be able to submit your request prior to your departure to your N Uin program location in the Fall  You will also need to be sure to confirm other requirements needed by the admissions office before your I 20 request submission  At that time  you will then be able to submit an electronic I 20 request through myOGS  OGS encourages you to submit your initial I 20 request as soon as possible  ideally no later than November  to provide ample time for the issuance of the I 20 and your F 1 visa application process prior to your enrollment
Applying for the F 1 Visa
We recommend that international students apply for an F 1 visa and attend a visa interview in their home country before beginning the N U in program  However  if you are not able to do so  and there is not time to return home prior to the spring semester in the U S   contact the U S  embassy in the country of the N U  in program to check for the possibility of applying for an F 1 visa in the specific N U in location
