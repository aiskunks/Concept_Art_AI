Guidelines on Maintaining Status
The goal of the Office of Global Services  OGS  is to support you in achieving your personal  academic  and professional goals during your time in the U S  As an international student with F 1 or J 1 nonimmigrant student status  in addition to the challenges of attending a degree program in a foreign country and navigating intercultural differences  you have the added responsibility of maintaining your F 1 or J 1 student status to remain in the U S  and successfully complete your degree
While it is your responsibility to maintain your status  the OGS is here to help guide you to understand the U S  government s regulations and procedures  One of the first ways to learn more about these rules and regulations is through our International Student Orientation  Due to the complexity of U S  immigration regulations  we recommend that you contact our office directly for advising on your F 1 J 1 student status  rather than relying on indirect information from other sources  such as friends or the Internet
U S  federal government regulations require all F 1 and J 1 international students to maintain valid nonimmigrant status  We recommend that you reference the information on this webpage often during your time in the U S  to ensure you are meeting all requirements to maintain your status
Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information  Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements
F 1 Students  Please also review the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on the Study in the States website regarding maintaining F 1 status
Maintaining Lawful F 1 J 1 Status
As an F 1 or J 1 student  you must meet certain obligations in order to maintain lawful immigration status  Maintaining status is necessary in order to receive the benefits of F 1 or J 1 status  such as employment authorization and program extension  and can be crucial to a successful application for a change or adjustment of non immigrant status in the future  Failure to maintain your non immigrant status can result in serious problems with immigration and could lead to deportation from the U S
Consequences of Not Maintaining Your Status
If you fail to maintain your F 1 J 1 status  your legal permission to remain in the U S   utilize the F 1 or J 1 status benefits  such as practical training and employment  as well as your ability to return to the U S  in the future  may be impacted  This also applies to your accompanying F 2 J 2 dependents  status
If you think you may have violated your visa status  please immediately contact OGS  who will schedule an appointment with you to discuss your situation and your options  The options for regaining F 1 status after a status violation are outlined on the OGS website

Keep Copies of all Immigration Related Documents  I 20s  DS 2019s  etc

Keep your I 20 or DS 2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date  Remember that your I 20 DS 2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record  and if things change  you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated
Extend your I 20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date
In the event of change of academic program or level  update your I 20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations  see the  Change of Degree Level  section below

Maintain On Ground Presence in Classes
Students must maintain on ground presence throughout the academic term  At Northeastern  there are four different defined instructional methods  Traditional  Hybrid  Live Cast  and Online  The traditional format for courses is fully on ground and meets the F 1 on ground presence requirements  Hybrid courses and Live Cast courses meet the F 1 on ground presence requirements  However  the combination of all hybrid courses plus one online course toward the full time enrollment requirement is not acceptable for maintaining the F 1 on ground presence requirements
J 1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full time on ground requirements
You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar s website
ONLINE LIMITATIONS
The U S  federal government does not look favorably on F 1 students participating in online courses and imposes limitations on online course enrollment

one 4 credit online course in a 4 credit enrollment system
