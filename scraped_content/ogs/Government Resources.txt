Scam alert   imposter calls
If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation  beware  Hang up and report it

A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number  When you answer  the person on the phone poses as a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer  The scammer  or scammers  will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process  Then  they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information  demand payment  and threaten you with deportation  arrest  or other negative consequences if you do not comply
The scammer will then order victims to make a payment   and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card  gift card  voucher  money order or make some other wire transfer  money exchange  payment or withdrawal   Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides
