On July 12th  the USCIS implemented a feature on I 765 applications called  myProgress  that will eventually allow OPT STEM applications to see more detail about their pending applications  Unfortunately  there was a glitch with this feature showing a biometrics appointment requirement  Please note that students can disregard this as biometrics appointments are NOT currently required for I 765 applicants in the C03B and C03C eligibility categories for OPT STEM OPT  Additionally  the estimated processing times are NOT accurate  as this is taking into account estimated times for all types of I 765 applications  not just OPT STEM OPT
