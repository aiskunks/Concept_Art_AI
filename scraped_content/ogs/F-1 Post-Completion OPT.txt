For example  if you finish all of your courses in May  but your degree conferral is in August  your I 20 end date will be a May date if you have no registration over the summer
PhD student Program Completion Dates
Students in the PhD program may choose the date of completion based on any of the following dates

Here are some general suggestions to help you make the best decision for your situation
If you have a job offer and your job starts during your 60 day grace period  use the job start date  or earlier  as your requested start of OPT
If you have a job offer and it starts after your 60 day grace period  use the latest date possible  59th day of grace period  for your OPT start date
Reminder  Students are not eligible to begin working until the Post OPT has been approved by USCIS  they have received their EAD  and the start date on the EAD has arrived
