After Landing in the U S
Primary Inspection
When you arrive at the U S  Port of Entry  you will first go through Primary Inspection  This is where a Customs   Border Protection  CBP  officer will review your documents to determine if you may enter the U S  They may also ask you some basic questions  Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed  Here are some tips
Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F 1 student  or a J 1 exchange visitor when you present your I 20 and F 1 visa or DS 2019 and J 1 visa
You will be issued an electronic I 94  which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U S  which should be F 1 student status or J 1 exchange visitor status
Currency  if you or the family members you are travelling carry currency amounting to more than  10 000  you must fill out an additional form to declare this  More information can be found here
Food items  there are restrictions on certain food and agricultural items that are allowed into the US  Please reference the CBP website for more details
Generally  this step should not last more than a few minutes  Until recently  visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports  and the CBP officers noted D S  Duration of Status  on F 1 and J 1 visa passport pages  this meant you are allowed to stay in the U S  for the length of time indicated on your I 20 or DS 2019  provided that you maintain full time enrollment and a valid F 1 J 1 visa status
Many U S  airports have discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U S  Instead  each time you enter the U S   the CBP creates an online  electronic entry record to record your entry into the U S  This is called your I 94 record  Scroll down to read Check Your I 94 Record for more information
If everything is in order  the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected  and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and or transfer  Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area
If the officer has additional questions  you may be directed to Secondary Inspection
Secondary Inspection
Secondary Inspection  also called Deferred Inspection  allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry  It is not a punishment and does not mean that you will be denied entry
The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status  If additional information regarding your F 1 or J 1 status is needed  please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official  DSO  for F 1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer  ARO  for J 1 visa holders  using the following contact information  The operations center is staffed 24 7 for this purpose
International Safety Office
1 617 373 2121  NUPD

This office is open even outside of normal business hours

Office of Global Services

email protected
Please see our Contact page for operations hours
Most importantly  ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties  More information on Secondary Inspection can be found here
Check Your I 94 Record
The I 94 is an admission record that contains information about your most recent entry to the U S  It is issued to all international travelers who enters the U S   with the exceptions of those who are part of a visa waiver program   and is updated with each entry you make  It contains your basic biographical information  as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U S
Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US  you should retrieve your electronic I 94 record here  Note that it may take a few days after your entry for the record to populate  You should check and save a screenshot of your I 94 record each time you enter the U S  as the I 94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U S
Please review your I 94 record for accuracy  Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are  Class of Admission  and  Admit Until Date   These fields should be filled out as follows
Class of Admission  matches what is listed on your visa stamp
Admit Until Date  D S  This stands for  Duration of Status
Visa status other than F 1 J 1 must be corrected immediately  B 1 B 2  WT  or WB status does not permit full time study in the U S
If anything looks incorrect on your I 94 record  please visit this page for more information on how to request a correction
Form I 515 or I 515A
The CBP officer may issue you a Form I 515A if you are missing paperwork  or if they are not able to verify your status  This form allows you temporary entrance into the US for up to 30 days  during which time you must collect and submit the necessary evidence to the government to be able to remain in the US for the duration of your F 1 or J 1 status
If you receive a Form I 515A  the Office of Global Services  OGS  is happy to provide guidance with your response to the government  Please complete the Request to Comply with I 515A e form to notify us so that we may best assist
Note that an I 515A should not have any negative impact on your status as long as you respond in a timely manner  More information on the form I 515A can be found here
Departing the Airport
Car Service
A car service is great way to pre arrange a convenient and safe ride from the airport to your final destination  OGS recommends Boston Carriage  Click here to visit their website and enter your reservation details  Use promo code HUSKY2020 for a 5  discount
Tips for using Boston Carriage
Book your ride in advance as soon as possible to guarantee that there is availability on your date of travel  You will receive detailed instructions about where to meet your driver upon your arrival
Make sure to build in a 60 minute delay for clearing Customs   Border Protection and baggage claim after your flight arrival time
Traveling with friends or family  Consider booking a van instead of a car so there is enough room for your luggage
Expect  no contact service  to decrease risk of COVID 19 transmission  this means all cars are outfitted with a partition between the driver and passenger area  the driver will be wearing a face mask  and vehicles will be sanitized before after pick up
Ride Share Apps  such as Uber or Lyft
Download the app before you travel  You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver
Some airports  such as Boston Logan  have a designated Ride App pick up area  After collecting your luggage from baggage claim  follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride
Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car
Ask your driver to wear a mask and put down the windows for airflow to decrease risk of transmission of COVID 19
Public Transportation
Depending on your final destination  public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city  Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination  Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive
Traveling to Northeastern for Commencement
International students  who graduated in a previous academic term  but who want to participate in graduate ceremonies at a later date  for example  a student who graduates at the end of the fall academic term wants to participate in graduation ceremonies at the end of the spring academic term   will have a Completed SEVIS record if they did not apply for Optional Practical Training  OPT  or continue in a new academic program  This means that your F 1 J 1 visa and I 20 DS 2019 are no longer valid for entry to the U S   even if they have a future end date  as you are no longer enrolled in a program of study
Do not request a travel signature since you are no longer eligible for this benefit
Utilize alternate visas for travel to the U S  such as a Visitor Visa or the Visa Waiver Program if you are a citizen of a participating country

How do I know if I need to submit a Change of Degree Level  CDL  request
If you are a current  continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern  you must submit a Change of Degree Level e form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program  Once the request is approved  OGS will issue you a new Form I 20 DS 2019 that reflects the new degree program
Please note  this does NOT apply to Bachelor s degree level students who are simply changing their major  For Bachelor s degree level changes of major  please submit the I 20 Request for Continuing Students
Below you will find a list of scenarios that would require submitting a Change of Degree Level  CDL  request to OGS
Change from Global Scholars to Bachelor s degree level
Change from pathway program to Bachelor s degree level

Change from Bachelor s degree level to Graduate Certificate program

When do I need to submit the CDL request
You must submit a Change of Degree Level e form request to myOGS prior to starting the new program  and no later than 60 days after the program end date listed on the I 20 for your current previous degree program  This is technically your 60 day grace period
After the 60 days  if no action is taken on your SEVIS record  the record will automatically complete  If you do not submit your CDL request in a timely manner  you will no longer be eligible for a CDL I 20  and will need to depart the U S  immediately and request a new Initial I 20 to return for the new degree program
Please also note that the start term for your new degree program must be the earliest possible start term  no later than 5 months after you complete or end your previous program
Requirements to Submit the CDL Request

Please note that you will be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree
Enrollment after a CDL
Your first term on the new CDL I 20 is considered your first term in a new program   therefore it is a required term  This means that you must maintain full time enrollment with appropriate on ground presence  even if it is the summer term

You can remain in the U S  in the time between degree programs  as long as you request the CDL in a timely manner following the deadlines explained in the section above
If you depart the U S  after the program end date on the I 20 for your previous degree program  you will need to wait until you receive the new CDL I 20 for your new degree program to enter the U S
As your SEVIS ID and school name on your CDL I 20 as your previous I 20  your previously issued F 1 visa should remain valid for travel as long as it has not expired
Employment and Change of Degree Level
On Campus Employment
You may continue any on campus employment during the time between degree levels only if you have received the Change of Degree level I 20
OPT   STEM OPT Employment

About Deferrals
We at OGS understand that our international students have experienced many obstacles this year  as visa delays and travel restrictions have interfered with study plans  This is a stressful situation  and advisors and leadership at OGS prioritize our students  need and want to ensure that all students have the information that needed in order to make the best decisions about your education
If you have decided that deferring is the best decision  below you will find some information about how to navigate that process and prepare your record to join NU for the following term
Deferral Process
1
The first step in the deferral process is to communicate with your college  program through your admissions contact  They will need to update your admissions record to reflect your new start date  Please see the links below to discover the process for your program
If you are a continuing student  you do not need to contact admissions  Please be in touch directly with your department

After your admissions contact in your college  program has confirmed your deferral  you will need to request a new I 20 with a new program start date  This is important because it will 1  prevent your SEVIS record from being cancelled if you are not in the US this term and 2  will allow you to travel with current and accurate documents
Request a new I20
Requests for I 20s for programs starting in Winter CPS 2024 quarter or Spring 2024 semester will be available from OGS in late September or October 2023
If you had previously paid for the I 901 SEVIS fee  you will be able to request SEVP to transfer that payment to your new SEVIS record once it has been created
Basics of F 1 Dependents
A dependent is a spouse or children  unmarried under the age of 21   If you would like to have dependents accompany you during your study in the U S   you will need to indicate this when completing your I 20 request e form as well as providing the following
provide a color copy of the identity page of the passport for your dependent s
show additional funding on your financial documents for your dependents
For your spouse  add  10 000 to the estimated expenses for your program of study
For your child children  add  6 000 per person to the estimated expenses for your program of study
Applying for F 2 Dependent Visa
New students may choose to apply for F 2 I 20 s for family members while they apply for their initial I 20
Also  current continuing students and students on Optional Practical Training may request an I 20 for a dependent by using the Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I 20 DS 2019
Once your dependent receives their F 2 I 20  they will need to schedule their visa appointment at a U S  Consulate abroad  It may be possible for them to apply for their F 2 visas at the same time that you have an appointment to obtain your F 1 visa  You should check with the consulate you plan to visit for details  It is also possible for your dependent s  to join you in the U S  at a later time  Pay close attention to the important information below
Dependents do not need to pay a Student and Exchange Visitor Information System  SEVIS  fee
F 2 dependents may not work during their stay in the U S
Your F 2 spouse may study part time  and F 2 children should attend school full time while you study in the U S
Basics of J 1 Dependents
A J 1 exchange visitor spouse  and unmarried children under the age of 21  are eligible for J 2 status  The day the child turns 21 he or she is no longer eligible for a dependent J 2 status  Each J 2 dependent must have his or her own Form DS 2019  J 2 visa holders do not have to pay the SEVIS fee
Each J 2 dependent may accompany or follow to join the J 1 exchange visitor in the U S  while the J 1 exchange visitor maintains status  All J 2 dependents are required to comply with applicable federal regulatory requirements  Please see Maintaining J 2 Status section below for more information
After arriving in the U S   to request DS 2019 for accompanying dependent s   please submit Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I 20 DS 2019  Please note  you may need to show additional funding for dependent expenses
Obtaining a J 2 Visa
Spouse and or children  under age 21  will receive his her own SEVIS generated DS 2019  with his her own SEVIS number
The J 2 visa may be obtained by bringing the dependent s DS 2019 form and proof of adequate funding to a U S  Consulate
Proof of marriage for spouse and a birth certificate for each child may be requested for J 2 visa applicants
You are also required to complete a separate visa application form for each child  even if they are included on a parent s passport
It is preferred that families apply for J 1 and J 2 visas at the same time  but if the spouse and children must apply separately at a later time  they should bring copies of the student visa holder s passport with the J 1 visa stamp and his her DS 2019 along with all other required documents
Maintaining J 2 status
J 2 dependents may study part time or full time in the U S  while the J 1 exchange visitor is in valid status
J 2 dependents must also be covered by health insurance for the duration of the J 1 program
J 2 dependent children over the age of 21 are no longer eligible for J 2 status and will need to change to another status if they wish to remain in the U S

Executive order timeline
January 29  2018   Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules against third travel ban
During the first week in December  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on President Trump s third travel ban  On Dec  22  2017  the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that partially blocked the third travel ban  The Ninth Circuit ruled that the travel ban will not be enforced against  foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States   The U S  Supreme Court s decision in December  however  supersedes the Ninth Circuit s decision  The U S  Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could fully implement and enforce the third travel ban on all eight countries  On Jan  6  2018  the Trump administration petitioned the U S  Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit s decision  which the U S  Supreme Court granted on Jan  19   The U S  Supreme Court will consider 4 questions
Whether courts can review a challenge to the travel ban executive order at all
Whether the executive order falls within the president s authority over immigration
Whether the Hawaii district court s order applies too broadly  and
Whether the executive order violates the Constitution s establishment clause
At this time  the Fourth Circuit has not issued a decision  Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available   Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions
December 8  2017   USA Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce travel ban until lower courts rule on challenges
The U S  Supreme Court issued an order on Dec  4  2017  allowing the Trump administration to implement fully and enforce its newest travel ban while lower courts continue to consider challenges to it
Travel restrictions  which vary by country  will affect certain nationals of Chad  Iran  Libya  North Korea  Somalia  Syria  Venezuela  and Yemen  unless exempt or granted a waiver pursuant to a presidential proclamation that was issued on Sept  24
The Trump administration had previously been barred from implementing the ban on its intended effective date of Oct  18  2017  after two lower federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily enjoined enforcement of most of the ban s restrictions  Following the Trump administration s appeal of those rulings and request for temporary permission to implement the proclamation  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the ban to take effect partially  but exempted travelers with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States  The Dec  4 order by the Supreme Court removes the relationship exemption and allows the Trump administration to implement the ban fully while challenges continue in the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Ninth Circuits
Specific travel restrictions
Effective Dec  8  2017  the Trump administration will fully implement the U S  Supreme Court s Dec  4  2017  order  and nationals of the eight countries will be subject to the following U S  travel limitations  unless otherwise exempt
Chad  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Iran  No nonimmigrant visas except F and M student visas and J exchange visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Libya  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
North Korea  No nonimmigrant  immigrant  or diversity lottery visas
Somalia  Nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to heightened scrutiny  no immigrant or diversity visas
Syria  No nonimmigrant  immigrant  or diversity lottery visas
Venezuela  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visas for officials of designated Venezuelan government agencies  other visa holders are subject to verification of traveler information  no restrictions on immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Yemen  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Exemptions and waivers
Several classes of foreign nationals are exempt from the restrictions  including U S  lawful permanent residents  dual nationals traveling on a passport from a non restricted country  foreign nationals who hold a valid U S  visa or advance parole  and those who were physically in the United States on the applicable original effective date of the travel restrictions
Those who are not exempt may request a waiver when applying for a visa  To be eligible for a waiver  a foreign national must demonstrate that he or she would suffer undue hardship if denied entry  and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to U S  national security or public safety and would be in U S  national interest  Waivers are discretionary and may be difficult to obtain
What this means for travelers
Foreign nationals who are currently in the United States  hold a passport from a restricted country  other than exempt dual nationals   and would need to apply for a visa to reenter the United States should carefully consider the risks of international travel and the potential for significant delays
As a reminder  all foreign nationals including those exempt from the travel restrictions are subject to national security screening and the potential for additional vetting when applying for a U S  visa or admission to the United States
Looking ahead
The travel restrictions will be implemented while the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal continue to hear challenges to the presidential proclamation  The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec  6  2017  while the Fourth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec  8  2017
Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available  Please contact the university s Office of Global Services at  email protected  if you have any questions
October 26  2017   The Department of Homeland Security began requiring airlines to implement enhanced security measures for flights destined to the USA
These enhanced security measures include enhanced screening of passengers and their electronic devices as well as an increase in security standards for aircrafts and airports  More information on the new security standards can be found in the DHS Fact Sheet  Aviation Enhanced Security Measures for All Commercial Flights to the United States
September 27  2017   Country specific travel ban issued
President Trump issued a proclamation that imposes new travel restrictions on eight countries  Five of the eight countries Iran  Libya  Somalia  Syria  and Yemen were included in the previous travel ban  while three countries Chad  North Korea  and Venezuela were added to the revised list
The new restrictions were issued on Sept  24  2017  just as the old 90 day travel ban expired  and will go into effect on Oct  18  Until then  by virtue of the proclamation  the  old  travel ban will continue for individuals from those countries still on the list who do not have a bona fide relationship with a U S  person or entity
The new restrictions will not be applied to
Current lawful permanent residents
Current visa holders
Dual nationals traveling on a passport from an unaffected country
Asylees
Refugees already admitted to the U S
Individuals granted protection under the Convention Against Torture
Restrictions by country
Chad  Libya  and Yemen
Entry as immigrants and non immigrants in business and tourist status is suspended
Iran
Entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants is suspended  except for those in valid student  F and M  or exchange visitor  J  status
Syria and North Korea
Entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants is suspended
Venezuela
Entry in tourist or business visitor status is suspended for officials of certain government agencies involved in screening and vetting practices and their immediate family members
Somalia
Entry as immigrants is suspended and decisions regarding entry as non immigrants will be subject to additional scrutiny
Although Iraq is not technically covered by the new restrictions  the proclamation notes that Iraqi nationals will be subject to additional scrutiny
How long these restrictions will last is uncertain  Countries may be removed or added to the list based upon further review of the effectiveness of their security practices
Waivers will be available on  undue hardship  grounds if a consulate determines the entry would not pose a threat to national security and the admission would be in the national interest  This could include individuals who have already been admitted to the U S  for extended periods of time
The Supreme Court was set to hear the travel ban case on Oct  10  The justices canceled that hearing and asked the parties to submit new briefs by Oct  5
Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available  Please contact the university s Office of Global Services if you have any questions
March 8  2017
President Trump has signed a revised executive order that will suspend the entry of nationals of Iran  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria  and Yemen for a period of 90 days beginning March 16 at 12 01 a m  ET  The new order rescinds the president s Jan  27 travel ban  which a federal court suspended last month  The new travel restrictions will be in effect through June 14  2017  However  the order indicates that ban could be extended and additional countries could be subject to restrictions
Who is subject to the revised executive order
The executive order prohibits nationals of the six restricted countries from entering the United States unless they qualify for an exemption or are granted a waiver  Iraqi nationals are no longer included in the ban  The order also suspends the admission of refugees from any country  including Syria  for 120 days as of March 16
The following classes of foreign nationals will be exempt from the ban
U S  lawful permanent residents  green card holders
Holders of a valid U S  visa  even if they have not yet used it  Visas that were provisionally revoked under the Jan  27 executive order should be valid for travel  Foreign nationals with a visa that was physically cancelled under the Jan  27 executive order may be entitled to a new travel document for entry to the U S
Dual nationals traveling on a valid passport from a non restricted country  Dual nationals must hold a valid U S  visa or be visa exempt
Foreign nationals holding a valid advance parole document
Foreign nationals holding a valid A  C 2  G  or NATO visa
Foreign nationals granted asylum
Refugees already admitted to the U S  and those with travel formally scheduled by the State Department
Once the order is in effect  non exempt nationals of the restricted countries will be prohibited from entering the U S  for the duration of the ban unless they are granted a waiver
Until the new executive order takes effect  the Department of State indicates that it will continue to process visa applications from nationals of the six restricted countries  However  applicants should be prepared for lengthy security screening and the possibility that they may not be issued a visa before the entry ban takes effect
Waivers of the entry ban
The executive order permits the Departments of Homeland Security and State to grant discretionary waivers of the entry ban  Waiver applicants must show that a denial of entry would cause undue hardship and that their entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to national security
The executive order suggests that a waiver may be appropriate for several classes of foreign nationals  including   1  individuals previously admitted to the U S  for a continuous period of work  study  or another long term activity who are seeking to resume that activity   2  individuals with previously established significant contacts with the U S    3  individuals with significant business or professional obligations in the U S    4  individuals seeking to visit or reside with a close family member   5  individuals who are infants  young children or adoptees  or needing urgent medical care  or otherwise justified by the special circumstances   6  individuals employed by or on behalf of the U S  government   7  individuals who are permanent Canadian residents applying for a visa in Canada  and  8  individuals traveling as a U S  government sponsored exchange visitor  Given the stringent criteria  however  waivers may be difficult to obtain
Processing of immigration applications and petitions
The executive order limits the Department of State interview waiver program for nonimmigrant visa applicants  Though foreign nationals from non restricted countries may still qualify for an exemption from an in person visa interview  visa applicants should check the website of the relevant U S  consulate for specific information  which is subject to frequent change
In addition to the entry ban  the president has issued a memorandum directing the Departments of Homeland Security  State  and Justice to implement more stringent vetting of applications and petitions for immigration benefits  Enhanced security screening could take effect quickly  and may delay processing at U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services and at U S  consulates
March 17  2017   Federal courts in Hawaii  Maryland temporarily block revised travel ban
On March 15  one day before President Trump s revised executive order was slated to go into effect  the U S  District Court in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary block preventing the government from enforcing or implementing Section 2  90 day travel ban  and Section 6  120 day U S  refugee program suspension  of the revised order
Also  early on March 16  the U S  District Court in Maryland issued a separate ruling barring enforcement nationwide of the 90 day travel ban
Other sections of the revised executive order not included in the court s decision became effective at 12 01 a m  ET on March 16  including Section 5  uniform screening and vetting standards for all immigration programs   Section 7  rescission of exercise of authority relating to terrorism grounds of inadmissibility   Section 8  expedited completion of biometric entry exit tracking system   Section 9  visa interview security   and Section 10  visa validity reciprocity
The U S  Department of State announced that due to the litigation  U S  embassies and consulates will continue to process visas for nationals of the six targeted countries  Nationals of Iran  Libya  Somalia  Syria  Sudan and Yemen may continue to travel into the U S  for the immediate future  if otherwise admissible

September 1  2017   State Department replaces  30 60 Day Rule
On Sept  1  the Department of State eliminated the  30 60 Day Rule  regarding adjustment of status applications  This rule assisted officials in determining whether an individual would be inadmissible due to inconsistent conduct  The  90 Day Rule  replaced the prior rule and applies to both immigrant and non immigrant visa applicants  The new rule provides individuals seeking an adjustment of status less flexibility to postpone filings  The  90 Day Rule  can be found here  https   fam state gov fam 09FAM 09FAM030209 html

The Department of Homeland Security has directed its agency to adjudicate applications and petitions filed for or on behalf of individuals in the U S   regardless of their country of origin  Also  all U S  ports of entry will resume admission of non immigrant and immigrant visa holders  including refugees  according to policies and procedures existing prior to the Executive Order
The Court of Appeals instructed attorneys for each party to file briefs by 11 a m  on Thursday  Feb  16  arguing whether the government s motion for a stay should be considered again by the entire appeals court  To hold a rehearing  a majority of the 29 active judges on the court would need to vote in favor of that motion
We will continue to provide updates on the pending litigation  Please contact the Office of Global Services  or We Care  if you have any questions
February 5  2017  President Aoun s Statement
To all members of the Northeastern University community
For the past decade  we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university  In doing so  we have set forth a series of core values such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger
I find the president s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable  I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student
Throughout the past week  I have had the opportunity to speak to many in our community who are directly affected by this new reality  I have listened to their stories and seen the anxiety etched in their faces
To the 250 Northeastern students and 31 faculty and staff impacted by this executive order  Your story is my story  You have my unwavering pledge that your university will stand by you  safeguard you  and be your home away from home  To my faculty and staff colleagues  Ensuring that all in our community can achieve their dreams without disruption is our highest priority  It is an honor to work with you on this charge
As we all know  Northeastern never stands idly by  observing from the sidelines  On Friday  we joined seven other leading universities in filing an amicus brief in federal court  Our brief makes clear that the executive order imperils our ability to have students and scholars collaborate and advance knowledge across borders  The order represents a threat to the mission of global higher education
In the aftermath of this executive order  it has become abundantly clear that the integration of diverse people  ideas  and cultures which universities like Northeastern make possible is more important than ever before
Let us turn this challenge into opportunity  Together  we will seize this moment to reaffirm our core values and strengthen our commitment to being a diverse  inclusive  and truly global university
I look forward to achieving this important work together
Sincerely
Joseph E  Aoun
President

Understanding the Executive Order and Implications for Our Community
Wednesday  Feb  8  10 11 30 a m   Curry Student Center Ballroom
Faculty and staff from Northeastern s School of Law  Office of General Counsel  Office of Global Services  as well as local immigration attorneys will provide an overview of what the Executive Order is  the implications behind the stay  the appeal process  and what this all means for Northeastern community members  The panel will discuss the differences between status adjustments  such as program extension or CPT  at the university level versus adjudications that need to be done by U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services
February 4  2017   USA Citizenship and Immigration Services Update
For students concerned about applying for Optional Practical Training  OPT   the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to adjudicate applications and petitions filed on behalf of individuals in the United States regardless of their country of origin  and applications and petitions of lawful permanent residents outside the U S  Applications to adjust status also continue to be adjudicated  according to existing policies and procedures  for applicants who are nationals of countries designated in the Jan  27  2017   Executive Order  Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States
February 4  2017   No Current Plans to Expand Travel Ban Beyond Current Countries
The Department of State confirmed that there is no addendum  annex  or amendment now being worked on to expand visa revocations or the travel ban to countries other than those currently implicated in the Executive Order
February 4  2017   Clarification from DHS and DOS re  Implementation of Executive Order on Immigration
On Friday  Feb  3  and effective immediately  a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump s week old immigration order from being enforced nationwide
Following the decision  the Department of Homeland Security said it has suspended all actions to implement the president s immigration order  The department will resume inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the executive order  according to a DHS statement
Meanwhile  the State Department said it has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the travel ban so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled
According to Customs and Border Protection  individuals who had their visas physically canceled as a result of the executive order will not need to reapply for a new visa  Absent any other admissibility issues  those individuals will receive an I 193 waiver  Application for Waiver of Passport and or Visa  upon arrival to the U S  For those traveling by air  airlines have been instructed to contact Customs and Border Protection to receive authorization to permit boarding
On Sunday  Feb  5  a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore the executive order
We continue to monitor all legal and implementation decisions related to the executive order and will provide information as it becomes available
February 1  2017   Travel Alert Under President Trump s Immigration Executive Order
On January 27  2017  President Trump issued an Executive Order suspending immigrant and non immigrant admissions to the U S  for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran  Iraq  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria  and Yemen  The Executive Order did not specifically categorize what categories of  individuals   i e   the definition of  individuals from   are subject to the ban  This broad generalization has led to widespread confusion at ports of entry across the U S   but since then the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has stated that travelers will be treated according to the travel document  passport  they present at the border  See https   www dhs gov news 2017 01 29 protecting nation foreign terrorist entry united states
Federal judges in several jurisdictions issued court rulings to stay the terms of the Executive Order that would have led to the removal of foreign nationals who arrived in the U S  with a valid visa or status as a lawful permanent resident  green card holder   These stays remain in effect but may be temporary  These court orders also do not apply to airports with pre clearance facilities  Dublin   Shannon  Ireland  Aruba  Freeport   Nassau  The Bahamas  Bermuda  Abu Dhabi  United Arab Emirates  and Calgary  Toronto  Edmonton  Halifax  Montreal  Ottawa  Vancouver  and Winnipeg  Canada   Nationals of the seven affected countries should avoid flying into the U S  from these airports  These court orders do not mean that anyone arriving with a visa is guaranteed entry  People with a non immigrant  temporary  visa from those 7 countries will be denied entry unless they can show that their admission is in the national interest and they do not pose a security threat
Citizens of the affected countries who hold dual citizenship with the U S  should not be directly affected  Non U S  citizens who hold dual citizenship with the affected countries and one other foreign country may be subject to the ban  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant deemed a threat to national security or public safety
This ban may include individuals who have traveled to one or more of the designated countries as well  even if they do not hold a nationality of one of the designated countries  Additional screening for those who have been in these countries should be expected  including the search and examination of luggage  mobile phones  computers  and electronics  including social media pages for any anti American communications or posts
Green card holders returning to the U S  after a short time abroad have the legal right to return to the U S   barring exceptional circumstances  On January 29  2017  the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that  the entry of lawful permanent residents  is in the national interest
Further  U S  Embassies and Consulates across the world have been instructed not to issue any non immigrant or immigrant visas to persons from the affected countries  consistent with the Executive Order  Also  individuals from one of the affected countries who have a pending immigration petition or application with U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  may experience delays in the adjudication of their cases
The Executive Order also contemplates that additional countries could be added to the banned list   Accordingly  until more information becomes available  and given the possibility of a change in government policy that could go into effect immediately  all foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the United States  We recommend that international students and scholars should not travel outside of the U S  without speaking with an advisor at the Office of Global Services  OGS  and or seeking advice from personal legal counsel who can review individual circumstances for potential available options or possible relief from the consequences of the Executive Order  The OGS can provide you with a list of personal immigration attorneys and a list of pro bono service providers
The OGS is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the university to offer resources and support for international students and scholars
Joseph Aoun  President of Northeastern University  sent a message to the entire Northeastern community on January 28  2017  stating   Let us strengthen our resolve to be a welcoming community that embraces the immeasurable benefits of diversity and inclusion  All in our community especially those who feel vulnerable as a result of this new paradigm should feel safe and secure at Northeastern  We  the leadership of the university  stand with you and will pursue every means available to safeguard each of you students  faculty  and staff
This alert is not legal advice  We will continue to provide updated information and guidance as it becomes available

For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F 1 status within the U S  or by travel and re entry  who otherwise qualify   Change of Status and Transfer Students please read that section further down on this page
Please note  It is an F 1 student s responsibility to maintain their F 1 status  In order to apply for CPT at Northeastern a student must be both academically eligible as well as compliant with U S  federal government regulations as outlined above
Application Process
To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U S   F 1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS  All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed  approved  and determined to be integral or required for degree completion  by the appropriate advisor  co op coordinator  or SEVIS contact
Step 1  Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e form
The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e form  The documents the student will need include
Electronic I 94   Class of Admission  must be F 1 and  Admit Until Date  must indicate  D S
Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization
When the student has submitted the e form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e form
Step 2  Secondary approver reviews student s CPT e form submission
The Secondary Approver  academic advisor  co op coordinator  or SEVIS contact  who receives the application will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion  If approved  the Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS
If the Secondary Approver does not approve of the request  they will email the student directly regarding their decision
Step 3  OGS reviews completed CPT e form submission
Upon receipt of the completed e form from the Secondary Approver  OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days   OGS will examine the student s documents to determine if they meet all F 1 eligibility requirements for CPT  OGS may place the request on hold and email the student advisor for more information or approve deny the CPT request

Video  Staying in Status on CPT
How CPT affects OPT eligibility
If an F 1 student exceeds 364 days of full time CPT  more than 20 hours per week at a degree level bachelor s  master s or doctorate   they will lose their eligibility to apply for OPT at that degree level
When counting CPT days  every day between the start and end date of CPT counts  including the start and end dates   The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization  not the days the student actually worked  This means even if it was a weekend  holiday  vacation etc   it still counts if the student had CPT authorization
It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full time CPT days have been used per degree level  Students can use previously issued I 20s to document this  Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e form
Part time CPT  20 hours per week or less  does not accrue time towards the 364 day calculation
Students who require more than 364 days of full time CPT at a degree level to complete their degree program are not in violation of their F 1 status  however they will lose OPT eligibility for the same degree level
OGS does not keep track and communicate if students will be exceeding the 364 day mark when students are requesting CPT authorization  Students must keep this in mind when requesting CPT authorization
Please Note  CPT is a benefit of F 1 status  not a guarantee  While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility  CPT authorization is directly tied to a student s academic curriculum  Therefore  the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study  as well as F 1 federal regulations  Simply because an F 1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization
Video  How CPT affects OPT Eligibility
Change of Status and Transfer Students
Change of status
Full time students who are applying to change their immigration status to F 1 within the U S   application through USICS  or by traveling  via consular processing  may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits  such as Curricular Practical Training  CPT   as long as the student has maintained full time F 1 enrollment requirements
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with an advisor to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you  for example a copy of your I 797 approval notice if you changed status within the U S
Transfer students
International students with Active F 1 records  who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University  and maintained status  may be able to use accrued time towards the one academic year requirement from the previous institution
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with an advisor to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available  for example a copy of your official transcript and previous I 20
Please note  if you transfer to Northeastern on an initial I 20  your one academic year accrual resets as an initial student

Reporting Post Completion OPT
Overview
Optional Practical Training  OPT  is an employment authorization benefit for F 1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their major field of study  It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to his her program of study  Students may engage in Pre Completion OPT  or Pre OPT  while actively enrolled in an academic program  To request Pre OPT work authorization  students must
Request a Pre OPT Recommendation in their SEVIS record from the Office of Global Services
Submit an application to U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  for review and adjudication
Students are eligible for a total of 12 months of Optional Practical Training  OPT  at each degree level  This means that any time for which a student receives Pre OPT authorization will be subtracted from the time available for Post Completion OPT
Note  Pre OPT work authorization is only available to students when they are actively enrolled at Northeastern  In order to request work authorization post graduation  students must submit an application for Post Completion OPT
Eligibility
A Bachelor s or Master s degree student may be eligible to apply for Pre OPT prior to completion of studies both during the academic year and during the annual vacation period

Special Considerations for PhD students
If a PhD student has completed all coursework but is in the final stages of thesis dissertation  immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre Completion OPT or Post Completion OPT while completing the thesis dissertation
In this case  the PhD student and his her college need to determine the program completion date  which will be reflected on the I 20
If you choose to apply for Post Completion OPT while completing your thesis dissertation
You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post OPT
The days you do not have a job count towards your 90 days of unemployment time
You cannot request a program extension even if your thesis dissertation is not completed after Post OPT is expired

Visa Application Outcomes
Approval
Congratulations  The majority of F 1 visa applicants are approved  You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after  They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you
Denials
Although F 1 visa denials are rare  the most common visa denial is under 214 b   which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent  and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country  family  job  education  property  that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S  and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post completion OPT or STEM OPT
The F 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions and is typically not a document driven process  Therefore  when an F 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b   Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial
If your F 1 visa application is denied under 214 b   you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer  Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F 1 visa  but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials
Administrative Processing
The outcome of some F 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g  or what is commonly referred to as  Administrative Processing   Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months  In these cases  the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information  or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing  Please note that this is not a visa denial  You should follow the instructions listed on the 221 g  notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy
If the 221 g  requires any information directly from Northeastern  please contact OGS by calling  1 617 373 2310  You will be instructed to share the 221 g  notice with an OGS advisor for further review
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing
Expedited Visa Appointments
U S  Embassies Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F 1 visa interview date if your I 20 program start date is within 60 days  and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date
The process to request an expedited F 1 visa interview varies by location  You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview  or on their online appointment scheduling site  You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment  such as your I 20 showing a program start date within 60 days
Please note  You must first submit the online visa application form  DS 160   pay the application fee  and schedule the first available interview appointment  Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment
Entering the U S
When preparing for your arrival to the U S   you should plan your travel according to the information provided by your college  According to immigration regulations  F 1 student visa holders can enter the U S  up to 30 days prior to the program report date on the I 20
Students transferring to Northeastern University in F 1 status from another institution or changing their degree level at Northeastern may stay in the U S  or travel between programs  And  they may enter the U S  more than 30 days before the new program start date listed on your I 20
Documents to Bring When Entering the U S
Valid passport with an official F 1 visa stamp
Your original I 20 issued by Northeastern University
I 901 SEVIS fee receipt

Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area  Do not enter the U S  in visitor status  B 1 B 2  WT  or WB   This status does not permit full time study in the U S
After your arrival  print your Admission  I 94  number at cbp gov I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents  I 94 information  F 1 visa  and I 20  for your personal records  Ensure your I 94 print out contains the correct information  including F 1 visa status and  Duration of Status

ABOUT THE PROGRAM
The mission of the Office of Global Services  Global Student Mentor Program is to support incoming international students as they transition to college life at Northeastern and to the culture of the United States  to foster engagement with the Northeastern community  and to improve resource utilization
A peer mentor is a current student who spends time with new students to help them adjust to college life  Both international and domestic students can apply to be peer mentors  The students who receive mentorship are called  mentees
Participating new students will be matched with an OGS Global Student Mentor  The mentor will reach out first over email and introduce themselves and set up the first meeting  Throughout the academic term  mentees will connect with their mentor in person through one on one meetings and group gatherings  These meetings take place in person and at least once per month  Mentees can ask questions and receive advice from the perspective of an experienced Northeastern student  Your mentor will help you to set goals for your experience at Northeastern  Mentees might consider discussing with their mentors
How to access resources on campus

Feelings of homesickness
It is important that mentees make the same level of commitment as their mentor  This includes being responsive to your mentor and making time in your schedule for regular meetings throughout the whole semester
Northeastern has many different mentorship programs  so please review other options to find which program best supports your interest and needs  The OGS program is dedicated to supporting international students in their cultural transition and academic success  Therefore  we cannot guarantee that your mentor will be a student in your same academic program  If you are interested in peer support specific to your academic program  please consult with your academic advisor to see what may be available  Additionally  this program is not for the purpose of career or workplace networking  though you may want to discuss strategies for professional networking with your mentor

Scam alert   imposter calls
If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation  beware  Hang up and report it
Here s how it works
A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number  When you answer  the person on the phone poses as a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer  The scammer  or scammers  will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process  Then  they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information  demand payment  and threaten you with deportation  arrest  or other negative consequences if you do not comply
The scammer will then order victims to make a payment   and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card  gift card  voucher  money order or make some other wire transfer  money exchange  payment or withdrawal   Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides
If you receive a call like that  hang up immediately  We will never ask for any form of payment over the phone or in an email  If we need payment  we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment  Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services official  In general  we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area
Steps you can take
If you have been a victim of this telephone or email scam  please report it to the Federal Trade Commission  If you receive a suspicious email or voice message and are not sure if it is a scam  forward it to the the USA Citizenship and Immigration Services webmaster at   email protected    We will review the messages received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate  Visit the Avoid Scams Initiative for more information on common scams and other important tips
If you have a question about your immigration record  please call the National Customer Service Center at 800 375 5283 or visit https   my uscis gov appointment to make an InfoPass appointment  You can also use myUSCIS to find up to date information about your application process

Guidelines on Maintaining Status
The goal of the Office of Global Services  OGS  is to support you in achieving your personal  academic  and professional goals during your time in the U S  As an international student with F 1 or J 1 nonimmigrant student status  in addition to the challenges of attending a degree program in a foreign country and navigating intercultural differences  you have the added responsibility of maintaining your F 1 or J 1 student status to remain in the U S  and successfully complete your degree
While it is your responsibility to maintain your status  the OGS is here to help guide you to understand the U S  government s regulations and procedures  One of the first ways to learn more about these rules and regulations is through our International Student Orientation  Due to the complexity of U S  immigration regulations  we recommend that you contact our office directly for advising on your F 1 J 1 student status  rather than relying on indirect information from other sources  such as friends or the Internet
U S  federal government regulations require all F 1 and J 1 international students to maintain valid nonimmigrant status  We recommend that you reference the information on this webpage often during your time in the U S  to ensure you are meeting all requirements to maintain your status
Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information  Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements
F 1 Students  Please also review the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on the Study in the States website regarding maintaining F 1 status
Maintaining Lawful F 1 J 1 Status
As an F 1 or J 1 student  you must meet certain obligations in order to maintain lawful immigration status  Maintaining status is necessary in order to receive the benefits of F 1 or J 1 status  such as employment authorization and program extension  and can be crucial to a successful application for a change or adjustment of non immigrant status in the future  Failure to maintain your non immigrant status can result in serious problems with immigration and could lead to deportation from the U S
Consequences of Not Maintaining Your Status
If you fail to maintain your F 1 J 1 status  your legal permission to remain in the U S   utilize the F 1 or J 1 status benefits  such as practical training and employment  as well as your ability to return to the U S  in the future  may be impacted  This also applies to your accompanying F 2 J 2 dependents  status
If you think you may have violated your visa status  please immediately contact OGS  who will schedule an appointment with you to discuss your situation and your options  The options for regaining F 1 status after a status violation are outlined on the OGS website
General Requirements
Click each topic below for more information
Immediately open and carefully read any emails you receive from  email protected   the Office of Global Services email
Our office will send any important information related to your F 1 J 1 status to your Northeastern email address
Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk spam folders for any missed emails from OGS
Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F 1 J 1 status
Report Any U S  Address or Phone Number Changes
F 1 and J 1 regulations require that you report any change to your U S  phone number or U S  local address within 10 days of the change
OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System  SEVIS  record  These changes are not reflected on your I 20 DS 2019 and do not require issuance of a new document
Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account
Graduated students on post completion OPT  STEM OPT  or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS
Keep Copies of all Immigration Related Documents  I 20s  DS 2019s  etc
OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents  as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents
Save each immigration document you are issued during your F 1 J 1 status  You may need them in the future
to document your employment history and your compliance with U S  immigration regulations

Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies  CPS
The same rules regarding maintaining full time enrollment  as explained above  apply to F 1 students in the College of Professional Studies  CPS   but there are important differences in program delivery   Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions  A and B  but still count as one full academic term  CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on ground courses throughout the entire term  For instance  F 1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term
F 1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility
Please note  if F 1 students need to withdraw drop from a course  they must withdraw drop from the additional online course and not any of the on ground core courses in order to maintain full time enrollment
Maintain On Ground Presence in Classes
Students must maintain on ground presence throughout the academic term  At Northeastern  there are four different defined instructional methods  Traditional  Hybrid  Live Cast  and Online  The traditional format for courses is fully on ground and meets the F 1 on ground presence requirements  Hybrid courses and Live Cast courses meet the F 1 on ground presence requirements  However  the combination of all hybrid courses plus one online course toward the full time enrollment requirement is not acceptable for maintaining the F 1 on ground presence requirements
J 1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full time on ground requirements
You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar s website
ONLINE LIMITATIONS
The U S  federal government does not look favorably on F 1 students participating in online courses and imposes limitations on online course enrollment

one 3 credit online course  or
one 4 credit online course in a 4 credit enrollment system
up to three credits total for 1 credit courses  i e   three 1 credit courses  or one 2 credit course and one 1 credit course

It is important that students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses  so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment
Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads
With minor exceptions for non required summer terms and your final term  you must maintain full time enrollment and should not drop below a full time courseload unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance
Students should not take a reduced course load or a non medical leave of absence without discussing these options and obtaining authorization from OGS before the start of the term or before dropping any course s  that would drop below full time enrollment

What is H 1B Status
The H 1B is temporary employment authorization that is used for nonimmigrant individuals in a specialty occupation  In order to become eligible for H 1B status  an employer must sponsor an individual and submit a petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS
Each year  the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has a limit  cap  of 65 000 new H 1B visas for individuals with a bachelor s degree or higher being sponsored by a cap subject employer  20 000 additional H 1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master s degree or higher earned at a U S  college or university  Some H 1B visas are not cap subject  including but not limited to those employed at institutions of higher education  nonprofit research organizations  or government research organizations  H 1B visas are adjudicated through a randomized system and begin on October 1 for cap subject employers
You can learn more about the H 1B Cap Season here
What is the Cap Gap Extension
The Cap Gap Extension is an automatic extension of F 1 status that may be granted to F 1 students who need to  bridge the gap  between the expiration of their OPT STEM EAD and the start date of their approved H 1B sponsored by a cap subject employer
Because new H 1Bs become effective on October 1 of each year  the Cap Gap Extension allows eligible F 1 students to remain in the U S  between the expiration of their OPT STEM Extension and the start of their H 1B
You can learn more about H 1B status and the Cap Gap Extension here
Cap Gap Extension Eligibility
Please be aware that the responsibility of the Office of Global Services  OGS  regarding H 1B petitions is minimal
As an F 1 student  you may be eligible for the Cap Gap extension if
You have maintained your F 1 status
You are the beneficiary of an H 1B petition that was timely filed by an employer that is cap subject
The H 1B petition requests a start date of October 1st and a change of status inside the U S
If you have applied for the H 1B via consular processing  you do not qualify for the Cap Gap Extension
The Cap Gap Extension is automatically applied to a student s SEVIS record  As such OGS is able to provide proof of the extension only if a student has been deemed eligible by USCIS
If Your H 1B Petition was Filed During Your 60 Day Grace Period
If your sponsoring employer filed the H 1B petition during your 60 day grace period  your Cap Gap Extension will allow you to remain in the U S  until the start date of your H 1B  unless your petition is rejected  denied  or withdrawn   However  your work authorization will not be extended  and you must stop working as of the expiration date on your EAD
Please Note  Once your SEVIS record completes for the change of status to H 1B  your F 1 status has ended  and OGS is not able to  revert  your status back to F 1
You can learn more about eligibility for the Cap Gap Extension here
How can I Request Proof of my Cap Gap Extension
Please fill out this e form  Cap Gap I 20 Request
You will need to provide proof of a qualifying  pending  or  approved  H 1B petition  If you are able to do so  OGS will issue you an updated I 20 reflecting your Cap Gap Extension of status  and extension of OPT STEM work authorization if applicable
Can I Apply for the STEM Extension During the Cap Gap Extension period
OGS DOES NOT advise students to submit an application for the STEM Extension after the expiration date of your OPT EAD  even when a student has received the Cap Gap Extension  It is the experience of OGS and other institutions that applications for the STEM Extension have a very high rate of denial when they are submitted to USCIS beyond the OPT EAD expiration date
If a student chooses to submit an application for the STEM Extension after their Cap Gap Extension has been applied but before their OPT EAD has expired  they are advised to also submit a letter to USCIS informing them of the date discrepancy that may exist between the actual OPT end date and the Cap Gap Extension end date  September 30   The letter should advise the adjudicators at USCIS that if the STEM Extension is approved  it must be approved based on the actual OPT end date  not based on the end date of the Cap Gap Extension  Please email  email protected  to request this letter template
If a student decides to continue on their STEM extension rather than changing to H 1B  they must ensure that the employer requests the withdrawal of the H 1B petition prior to October 1  If this is not done  the H 1B status will begin on October 1 and the student s eligibility for the STEM OPT extension will be cancelled
If a student decides to change to H 1B and not proceed with the STEM OPT extension application  the student should send a letter to the USCIS  requesting that the STEM application is withdrawn
H 1B Reporting
There are many complexities that an F 1 student may experience when changing their status from F 1 to H 1B
If your status has already changed or will be changing from F 1 to H 1B  please complete the H 1B Status Change Reporting e form  An OGS Designated School Official  DSO  will review the request and review your F 1 SEVIS record to ensure any changes are reflected accurately
You should fill out this e form
To report that your H 1B petition for change of status was approved  I 797A Approval Notice from USCIS
To report that your H 1B petition for consular processing was approved  I 797B Approval Notice from USCIS  and you have re entered the U S  in H 1B status
To report that your H 1B petition for consular processing was approved  I 797B Approval Notice from USCIS  but you have NOT re entered the U S  in H 1B status yet
To report that your H 1B petition was withdrawn by your employer
If you received a Request for Evidence  RFE  for your H 1B petition that requires you to provide information related to your F 1 non immigrant status or academic background  please submit the H 1B RFE Response Request e form
If your H 1B petition was denied  please submit the H 1B Denial Notification e form  OGS will review the denial notice to determine if any institutional support from OGS or Northeastern is appropriate
Impact of Changing to H 1B from F 1 Status
If you are approved for H 1B change of status  as of the effective date of the H 1B period  October 1 in most cases for cap subject employers   your F 1 status ends and your SEVIS record automatically completes  Unfortunately  in cases where students lose their H 1B employment  due to layoffs  for example  after they have already changed to H 1B  there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated  Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H 1B status  and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H 1B employment is terminated  and that simply reverting back to F 1 status is often not possible
Students whose F 1 status has or will be changing to H 1B status  or whose H 1B employment has been withdrawn  revoked  or denied  should submit the H 1B Status Change Reporting e form  or H 1B Denial Notification e form  as soon as possible so that OGS may review your case  If your H 1B was withdrawn revoked denied and you have questions related to your F 1 status  please also call OGS at  1 617 373 2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor
If your H 1B Employer Withdraws Revokes Your Petition
Please review the information provided on the USCIS website
If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H 1B effective start date  OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you re otherwise eligible  Please submit the H 1B Status Change Reporting e form so we can review your case
If your employer did not withdraw your H 1B petition until AFTER the approved H 1B effective start date  you are not eligible to have your F 1 SEVIS record returned to Active status  You may have a 60 day grace period during which to find alternative H 1B sponsors or apply for a change of status
Advising on your options for H 1B portability  change of status  or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors  We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options
Please review this additional information provided on the USCIS website regarding options following termination of H 1B employment
If Your Cap Subject H 1B Petition is Denied by USCIS
Please refer to the guidance provided on the USCIS website
If an H 1B petition filed for an F 1 student with a cap gap extension is denied  rejected  revoked  or withdrawn  the student will have the standard 60 day grace period  from the date of the notification of the denial  rejection  revocation  or withdrawal of the petition  to depart the United States
The 60 day grace period does not apply to an F 1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation  misrepresentation  or fraud  In such cases  the F 1 student is ineligible for cap gap extension of status and the 60 day grace period  Similarly  the 60 day grace period and cap gap extension of status does not apply to an F 1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation  fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval  In both of these instances  students are required to immediately leave the United States

After Landing in the U S
Primary Inspection
When you arrive at the U S  Port of Entry  you will first go through Primary Inspection  This is where a Customs   Border Protection  CBP  officer will review your documents to determine if you may enter the U S  They may also ask you some basic questions  Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed  Here are some tips
Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F 1 student  or a J 1 exchange visitor when you present your I 20 and F 1 visa or DS 2019 and J 1 visa
You will be issued an electronic I 94  which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U S  which should be F 1 student status or J 1 exchange visitor status
Currency  if you or the family members you are travelling carry currency amounting to more than  10 000  you must fill out an additional form to declare this  More information can be found here
Food items  there are restrictions on certain food and agricultural items that are allowed into the US  Please reference the CBP website for more details
Generally  this step should not last more than a few minutes  Until recently  visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports  and the CBP officers noted D S  Duration of Status  on F 1 and J 1 visa passport pages  this meant you are allowed to stay in the U S  for the length of time indicated on your I 20 or DS 2019  provided that you maintain full time enrollment and a valid F 1 J 1 visa status
Many U S  airports have discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U S  Instead  each time you enter the U S   the CBP creates an online  electronic entry record to record your entry into the U S  This is called your I 94 record  Scroll down to read Check Your I 94 Record for more information
If everything is in order  the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected  and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and or transfer  Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area
If the officer has additional questions  you may be directed to Secondary Inspection
Secondary Inspection
Secondary Inspection  also called Deferred Inspection  allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry  It is not a punishment and does not mean that you will be denied entry
The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status  If additional information regarding your F 1 or J 1 status is needed  please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official  DSO  for F 1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer  ARO  for J 1 visa holders  using the following contact information  The operations center is staffed 24 7 for this purpose
International Safety Office
1 617 373 2121  NUPD
email protected
This office is open even outside of normal business hours
This office can best support you when you have registered your travel in advance so that they can easily access your travel details
Office of Global Services
1 617 373 2310
email protected
Please see our Contact page for operations hours
Most importantly  ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties  More information on Secondary Inspection can be found here
Check Your I 94 Record
The I 94 is an admission record that contains information about your most recent entry to the U S  It is issued to all international travelers who enters the U S   with the exceptions of those who are part of a visa waiver program   and is updated with each entry you make  It contains your basic biographical information  as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U S
Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US  you should retrieve your electronic I 94 record here  Note that it may take a few days after your entry for the record to populate  You should check and save a screenshot of your I 94 record each time you enter the U S  as the I 94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U S
Please review your I 94 record for accuracy  Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are  Class of Admission  and  Admit Until Date   These fields should be filled out as follows
Class of Admission  matches what is listed on your visa stamp
Admit Until Date  D S  This stands for  Duration of Status
Visa status other than F 1 J 1 must be corrected immediately  B 1 B 2  WT  or WB status does not permit full time study in the U S
If anything looks incorrect on your I 94 record  please visit this page for more information on how to request a correction
Form I 515 or I 515A
The CBP officer may issue you a Form I 515A if you are missing paperwork  or if they are not able to verify your status  This form allows you temporary entrance into the US for up to 30 days  during which time you must collect and submit the necessary evidence to the government to be able to remain in the US for the duration of your F 1 or J 1 status
If you receive a Form I 515A  the Office of Global Services  OGS  is happy to provide guidance with your response to the government  Please complete the Request to Comply with I 515A e form to notify us so that we may best assist
Note that an I 515A should not have any negative impact on your status as long as you respond in a timely manner  More information on the form I 515A can be found here
Departing the Airport
Car Service
A car service is great way to pre arrange a convenient and safe ride from the airport to your final destination  OGS recommends Boston Carriage  Click here to visit their website and enter your reservation details  Use promo code HUSKY2020 for a 5  discount
Tips for using Boston Carriage
Book your ride in advance as soon as possible to guarantee that there is availability on your date of travel  You will receive detailed instructions about where to meet your driver upon your arrival
Make sure to build in a 60 minute delay for clearing Customs   Border Protection and baggage claim after your flight arrival time
Traveling with friends or family  Consider booking a van instead of a car so there is enough room for your luggage
Expect  no contact service  to decrease risk of COVID 19 transmission  this means all cars are outfitted with a partition between the driver and passenger area  the driver will be wearing a face mask  and vehicles will be sanitized before after pick up
Ride Share Apps  such as Uber or Lyft
Download the app before you travel  You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver
Some airports  such as Boston Logan  have a designated Ride App pick up area  After collecting your luggage from baggage claim  follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride
Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car
Ask your driver to wear a mask and put down the windows for airflow to decrease risk of transmission of COVID 19
Public Transportation
Depending on your final destination  public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city  Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination  Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive
Traveling to Northeastern for Commencement
International students  who graduated in a previous academic term  but who want to participate in graduate ceremonies at a later date  for example  a student who graduates at the end of the fall academic term wants to participate in graduation ceremonies at the end of the spring academic term   will have a Completed SEVIS record if they did not apply for Optional Practical Training  OPT  or continue in a new academic program  This means that your F 1 J 1 visa and I 20 DS 2019 are no longer valid for entry to the U S   even if they have a future end date  as you are no longer enrolled in a program of study
Do not request a travel signature since you are no longer eligible for this benefit
Utilize alternate visas for travel to the U S  such as a Visitor Visa or the Visa Waiver Program if you are a citizen of a participating country

About Deferrals
We at OGS understand that our international students have experienced many obstacles this year  as visa delays and travel restrictions have interfered with study plans  This is a stressful situation  and advisors and leadership at OGS prioritize our students  need and want to ensure that all students have the information that needed in order to make the best decisions about your education
If you have decided that deferring is the best decision  below you will find some information about how to navigate that process and prepare your record to join NU for the following term
Deferral Process
1
The first step in the deferral process is to communicate with your college  program through your admissions contact  They will need to update your admissions record to reflect your new start date  Please see the links below to discover the process for your program
If you are a continuing student  you do not need to contact admissions  Please be in touch directly with your department
All undergraduate programs  except CPS

2
After your admissions contact in your college  program has confirmed your deferral  you will need to request a new I 20 with a new program start date  This is important because it will 1  prevent your SEVIS record from being cancelled if you are not in the US this term and 2  will allow you to travel with current and accurate documents
Request a new I20
Requests for I 20s for programs starting in Winter CPS 2024 quarter or Spring 2024 semester will be available from OGS in late September or October 2023
If you had previously paid for the I 901 SEVIS fee  you will be able to request SEVP to transfer that payment to your new SEVIS record once it has been created
Basics of F 1 Dependents
A dependent is a spouse or children  unmarried under the age of 21   If you would like to have dependents accompany you during your study in the U S   you will need to indicate this when completing your I 20 request e form as well as providing the following
provide a color copy of the identity page of the passport for your dependent s
show additional funding on your financial documents for your dependents
For your spouse  add  10 000 to the estimated expenses for your program of study
For your child children  add  6 000 per person to the estimated expenses for your program of study
Applying for F 2 Dependent Visa
New students may choose to apply for F 2 I 20 s for family members while they apply for their initial I 20
Also  current continuing students and students on Optional Practical Training may request an I 20 for a dependent by using the Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I 20 DS 2019
Once your dependent receives their F 2 I 20  they will need to schedule their visa appointment at a U S  Consulate abroad  It may be possible for them to apply for their F 2 visas at the same time that you have an appointment to obtain your F 1 visa  You should check with the consulate you plan to visit for details  It is also possible for your dependent s  to join you in the U S  at a later time  Pay close attention to the important information below
Dependents do not need to pay a Student and Exchange Visitor Information System  SEVIS  fee
F 2 dependents may not work during their stay in the U S
Your F 2 spouse may study part time  and F 2 children should attend school full time while you study in the U S
Basics of J 1 Dependents
A J 1 exchange visitor spouse  and unmarried children under the age of 21  are eligible for J 2 status  The day the child turns 21 he or she is no longer eligible for a dependent J 2 status  Each J 2 dependent must have his or her own Form DS 2019  J 2 visa holders do not have to pay the SEVIS fee
Each J 2 dependent may accompany or follow to join the J 1 exchange visitor in the U S  while the J 1 exchange visitor maintains status  All J 2 dependents are required to comply with applicable federal regulatory requirements  Please see Maintaining J 2 Status section below for more information
After arriving in the U S   to request DS 2019 for accompanying dependent s   please submit Request for Student and Exchange Visitor Information System I 20 DS 2019  Please note  you may need to show additional funding for dependent expenses
Obtaining a J 2 Visa
Spouse and or children  under age 21  will receive his her own SEVIS generated DS 2019  with his her own SEVIS number
The J 2 visa may be obtained by bringing the dependent s DS 2019 form and proof of adequate funding to a U S  Consulate
Proof of marriage for spouse and a birth certificate for each child may be requested for J 2 visa applicants
You are also required to complete a separate visa application form for each child  even if they are included on a parent s passport
It is preferred that families apply for J 1 and J 2 visas at the same time  but if the spouse and children must apply separately at a later time  they should bring copies of the student visa holder s passport with the J 1 visa stamp and his her DS 2019 along with all other required documents
Maintaining J 2 status
J 2 dependents may study part time or full time in the U S  while the J 1 exchange visitor is in valid status
J 2 dependents must also be covered by health insurance for the duration of the J 1 program
J 2 dependent children over the age of 21 are no longer eligible for J 2 status and will need to change to another status if they wish to remain in the U S

Executive order timeline
January 29  2018   Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rules against third travel ban
During the first week in December  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on President Trump s third travel ban  On Dec  22  2017  the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that partially blocked the third travel ban  The Ninth Circuit ruled that the travel ban will not be enforced against  foreign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States   The U S  Supreme Court s decision in December  however  supersedes the Ninth Circuit s decision  The U S  Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could fully implement and enforce the third travel ban on all eight countries  On Jan  6  2018  the Trump administration petitioned the U S  Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit s decision  which the U S  Supreme Court granted on Jan  19   The U S  Supreme Court will consider 4 questions
Whether courts can review a challenge to the travel ban executive order at all
Whether the executive order falls within the president s authority over immigration
Whether the Hawaii district court s order applies too broadly  and
Whether the executive order violates the Constitution s establishment clause
At this time  the Fourth Circuit has not issued a decision  Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available   Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions
December 8  2017   USA Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce travel ban until lower courts rule on challenges
The U S  Supreme Court issued an order on Dec  4  2017  allowing the Trump administration to implement fully and enforce its newest travel ban while lower courts continue to consider challenges to it
Travel restrictions  which vary by country  will affect certain nationals of Chad  Iran  Libya  North Korea  Somalia  Syria  Venezuela  and Yemen  unless exempt or granted a waiver pursuant to a presidential proclamation that was issued on Sept  24
The Trump administration had previously been barred from implementing the ban on its intended effective date of Oct  18  2017  after two lower federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily enjoined enforcement of most of the ban s restrictions  Following the Trump administration s appeal of those rulings and request for temporary permission to implement the proclamation  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the ban to take effect partially  but exempted travelers with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States  The Dec  4 order by the Supreme Court removes the relationship exemption and allows the Trump administration to implement the ban fully while challenges continue in the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Ninth Circuits
Specific travel restrictions
Effective Dec  8  2017  the Trump administration will fully implement the U S  Supreme Court s Dec  4  2017  order  and nationals of the eight countries will be subject to the following U S  travel limitations  unless otherwise exempt
Chad  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Iran  No nonimmigrant visas except F and M student visas and J exchange visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Libya  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
North Korea  No nonimmigrant  immigrant  or diversity lottery visas
Somalia  Nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to heightened scrutiny  no immigrant or diversity visas
Syria  No nonimmigrant  immigrant  or diversity lottery visas
Venezuela  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visas for officials of designated Venezuelan government agencies  other visa holders are subject to verification of traveler information  no restrictions on immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Yemen  No B 1  B 2  or B 1 B 2 visitor visas  no immigrant or diversity lottery visas
Exemptions and waivers
Several classes of foreign nationals are exempt from the restrictions  including U S  lawful permanent residents  dual nationals traveling on a passport from a non restricted country  foreign nationals who hold a valid U S  visa or advance parole  and those who were physically in the United States on the applicable original effective date of the travel restrictions
Those who are not exempt may request a waiver when applying for a visa  To be eligible for a waiver  a foreign national must demonstrate that he or she would suffer undue hardship if denied entry  and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to U S  national security or public safety and would be in U S  national interest  Waivers are discretionary and may be difficult to obtain
What this means for travelers
Foreign nationals who are currently in the United States  hold a passport from a restricted country  other than exempt dual nationals   and would need to apply for a visa to reenter the United States should carefully consider the risks of international travel and the potential for significant delays
As a reminder  all foreign nationals including those exempt from the travel restrictions are subject to national security screening and the potential for additional vetting when applying for a U S  visa or admission to the United States
Looking ahead
The travel restrictions will be implemented while the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal continue to hear challenges to the presidential proclamation  The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec  6  2017  while the Fourth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec  8  2017
Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available  Please contact the university s Office of Global Services at  email protected  if you have any questions
October 26  2017   The Department of Homeland Security began requiring airlines to implement enhanced security measures for flights destined to the USA
These enhanced security measures include enhanced screening of passengers and their electronic devices as well as an increase in security standards for aircrafts and airports  More information on the new security standards can be found in the DHS Fact Sheet  Aviation Enhanced Security Measures for All Commercial Flights to the United States
September 27  2017   Country specific travel ban issued
President Trump issued a proclamation that imposes new travel restrictions on eight countries  Five of the eight countries Iran  Libya  Somalia  Syria  and Yemen were included in the previous travel ban  while three countries Chad  North Korea  and Venezuela were added to the revised list
The new restrictions were issued on Sept  24  2017  just as the old 90 day travel ban expired  and will go into effect on Oct  18  Until then  by virtue of the proclamation  the  old  travel ban will continue for individuals from those countries still on the list who do not have a bona fide relationship with a U S  person or entity
The new restrictions will not be applied to
Current lawful permanent residents
Current visa holders
Dual nationals traveling on a passport from an unaffected country
Asylees
Refugees already admitted to the U S
Individuals granted protection under the Convention Against Torture
Restrictions by country
Chad  Libya  and Yemen
Entry as immigrants and non immigrants in business and tourist status is suspended
Iran
Entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants is suspended  except for those in valid student  F and M  or exchange visitor  J  status
Syria and North Korea
Entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants is suspended
Venezuela
Entry in tourist or business visitor status is suspended for officials of certain government agencies involved in screening and vetting practices and their immediate family members
Somalia
Entry as immigrants is suspended and decisions regarding entry as non immigrants will be subject to additional scrutiny
Although Iraq is not technically covered by the new restrictions  the proclamation notes that Iraqi nationals will be subject to additional scrutiny
How long these restrictions will last is uncertain  Countries may be removed or added to the list based upon further review of the effectiveness of their security practices
Waivers will be available on  undue hardship  grounds if a consulate determines the entry would not pose a threat to national security and the admission would be in the national interest  This could include individuals who have already been admitted to the U S  for extended periods of time
The Supreme Court was set to hear the travel ban case on Oct  10  The justices canceled that hearing and asked the parties to submit new briefs by Oct  5
Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available  Please contact the university s Office of Global Services if you have any questions
March 8  2017
President Trump has signed a revised executive order that will suspend the entry of nationals of Iran  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria  and Yemen for a period of 90 days beginning March 16 at 12 01 a m  ET  The new order rescinds the president s Jan  27 travel ban  which a federal court suspended last month  The new travel restrictions will be in effect through June 14  2017  However  the order indicates that ban could be extended and additional countries could be subject to restrictions
Who is subject to the revised executive order
The executive order prohibits nationals of the six restricted countries from entering the United States unless they qualify for an exemption or are granted a waiver  Iraqi nationals are no longer included in the ban  The order also suspends the admission of refugees from any country  including Syria  for 120 days as of March 16
The following classes of foreign nationals will be exempt from the ban
U S  lawful permanent residents  green card holders
Holders of a valid U S  visa  even if they have not yet used it  Visas that were provisionally revoked under the Jan  27 executive order should be valid for travel  Foreign nationals with a visa that was physically cancelled under the Jan  27 executive order may be entitled to a new travel document for entry to the U S
Dual nationals traveling on a valid passport from a non restricted country  Dual nationals must hold a valid U S  visa or be visa exempt
Foreign nationals holding a valid advance parole document
Foreign nationals holding a valid A  C 2  G  or NATO visa
Foreign nationals granted asylum
Refugees already admitted to the U S  and those with travel formally scheduled by the State Department
Once the order is in effect  non exempt nationals of the restricted countries will be prohibited from entering the U S  for the duration of the ban unless they are granted a waiver
Until the new executive order takes effect  the Department of State indicates that it will continue to process visa applications from nationals of the six restricted countries  However  applicants should be prepared for lengthy security screening and the possibility that they may not be issued a visa before the entry ban takes effect
Waivers of the entry ban
The executive order permits the Departments of Homeland Security and State to grant discretionary waivers of the entry ban  Waiver applicants must show that a denial of entry would cause undue hardship and that their entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to national security
The executive order suggests that a waiver may be appropriate for several classes of foreign nationals  including   1  individuals previously admitted to the U S  for a continuous period of work  study  or another long term activity who are seeking to resume that activity   2  individuals with previously established significant contacts with the U S    3  individuals with significant business or professional obligations in the U S    4  individuals seeking to visit or reside with a close family member   5  individuals who are infants  young children or adoptees  or needing urgent medical care  or otherwise justified by the special circumstances   6  individuals employed by or on behalf of the U S  government   7  individuals who are permanent Canadian residents applying for a visa in Canada  and  8  individuals traveling as a U S  government sponsored exchange visitor  Given the stringent criteria  however  waivers may be difficult to obtain
Processing of immigration applications and petitions
The executive order limits the Department of State interview waiver program for nonimmigrant visa applicants  Though foreign nationals from non restricted countries may still qualify for an exemption from an in person visa interview  visa applicants should check the website of the relevant U S  consulate for specific information  which is subject to frequent change
In addition to the entry ban  the president has issued a memorandum directing the Departments of Homeland Security  State  and Justice to implement more stringent vetting of applications and petitions for immigration benefits  Enhanced security screening could take effect quickly  and may delay processing at U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services and at U S  consulates
March 17  2017   Federal courts in Hawaii  Maryland temporarily block revised travel ban
On March 15  one day before President Trump s revised executive order was slated to go into effect  the U S  District Court in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary block preventing the government from enforcing or implementing Section 2  90 day travel ban  and Section 6  120 day U S  refugee program suspension  of the revised order
Also  early on March 16  the U S  District Court in Maryland issued a separate ruling barring enforcement nationwide of the 90 day travel ban
Other sections of the revised executive order not included in the court s decision became effective at 12 01 a m  ET on March 16  including Section 5  uniform screening and vetting standards for all immigration programs   Section 7  rescission of exercise of authority relating to terrorism grounds of inadmissibility   Section 8  expedited completion of biometric entry exit tracking system   Section 9  visa interview security   and Section 10  visa validity reciprocity
The U S  Department of State announced that due to the litigation  U S  embassies and consulates will continue to process visas for nationals of the six targeted countries  Nationals of Iran  Libya  Somalia  Syria  Sudan and Yemen may continue to travel into the U S  for the immediate future  if otherwise admissible

August 8  2017   State Department updates policy guidance on F 1 student visa applications
On Aug  8  the Department of State revised its guidance to consular officers when considering F 1 student visas  The modification provides assistance to consular officers in determining whether an F 1 visa applicant plans to leave the United States after graduation  Due to these changes  students applying for F 1 visas may be asked additional questions regarding their long term plans and their ties to their home country  The revised policy guidelines can be found here  https   fam state gov fam 09FAM 09FAM040205 html  Northeastern will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available about the revised guidance  Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions
August 28  2017   In person interviews for employment based green card applicants to begin Oct  1
Beginning on Oct  1  in person interviews will be required for all applicants seeking an employment based green card  In the past  in person interviews could be waived if no additional information was needed  Citizenship and Immigration Services stated that the in person interviews will allow officers to verify information in applications  discover new relevant information  and assist with evaluating the credibility of applicants  More information about the in person interviews can be found here  https   www uscis gov news news releases uscis to expand in person interview requirements for certain permanent residency applicants
September 1  2017   State Department replaces  30 60 Day Rule
On Sept  1  the Department of State eliminated the  30 60 Day Rule  regarding adjustment of status applications  This rule assisted officials in determining whether an individual would be inadmissible due to inconsistent conduct  The  90 Day Rule  replaced the prior rule and applies to both immigrant and non immigrant visa applicants  The new rule provides individuals seeking an adjustment of status less flexibility to postpone filings  The  90 Day Rule  can be found here  https   fam state gov fam 09FAM 09FAM030209 html
September 13  2017   Trump Administration imposes visa sanctions on four countries
On Sept  13  the Trump administration imposed visa sanctions on Cambodia  Eritrea  Guinea  and Sierra Leone  According to officials  these four countries have refused to accept or have unreasonably delayed accepting deportees who have been convicted of crimes in the United States  Not all visas have been discontinued  The Department of Homeland Security s announcement regarding the specific visa sanctions can be found here  https   www dhs gov news 2017 09 13 dhs announces implementation visa sanctions four countries  Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will update this page as further information becomes available  Please contact the Office of Global Services at  email protected  if you have any questions

February 9  2017  USA 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to continue blocking President Trump s travel ban
The unanimous decision temporarily keeps in place a stay preventing a ban on immigration from seven Muslim majority countries
The Department of Homeland Security has directed its agency to adjudicate applications and petitions filed for or on behalf of individuals in the U S   regardless of their country of origin  Also  all U S  ports of entry will resume admission of non immigrant and immigrant visa holders  including refugees  according to policies and procedures existing prior to the Executive Order
The Court of Appeals instructed attorneys for each party to file briefs by 11 a m  on Thursday  Feb  16  arguing whether the government s motion for a stay should be considered again by the entire appeals court  To hold a rehearing  a majority of the 29 active judges on the court would need to vote in favor of that motion

February 5  2017  President Aoun s Statement
To all members of the Northeastern University community
For the past decade  we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university  In doing so  we have set forth a series of core values such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger
I find the president s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable  I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student
Throughout the past week  I have had the opportunity to speak to many in our community who are directly affected by this new reality  I have listened to their stories and seen the anxiety etched in their faces
To the 250 Northeastern students and 31 faculty and staff impacted by this executive order  Your story is my story  You have my unwavering pledge that your university will stand by you  safeguard you  and be your home away from home  To my faculty and staff colleagues  Ensuring that all in our community can achieve their dreams without disruption is our highest priority  It is an honor to work with you on this charge
As we all know  Northeastern never stands idly by  observing from the sidelines  On Friday  we joined seven other leading universities in filing an amicus brief in federal court  Our brief makes clear that the executive order imperils our ability to have students and scholars collaborate and advance knowledge across borders  The order represents a threat to the mission of global higher education
In the aftermath of this executive order  it has become abundantly clear that the integration of diverse people  ideas  and cultures which universities like Northeastern make possible is more important than ever before
Let us turn this challenge into opportunity  Together  we will seize this moment to reaffirm our core values and strengthen our commitment to being a diverse  inclusive  and truly global university
I look forward to achieving this important work together
Sincerely
Joseph E  Aoun
President

February 4  2017   USA Citizenship and Immigration Services Update
For students concerned about applying for Optional Practical Training  OPT   the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to adjudicate applications and petitions filed on behalf of individuals in the United States regardless of their country of origin  and applications and petitions of lawful permanent residents outside the U S  Applications to adjust status also continue to be adjudicated  according to existing policies and procedures  for applicants who are nationals of countries designated in the Jan  27  2017   Executive Order  Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States
February 4  2017   No Current Plans to Expand Travel Ban Beyond Current Countries
The Department of State confirmed that there is no addendum  annex  or amendment now being worked on to expand visa revocations or the travel ban to countries other than those currently implicated in the Executive Order
February 4  2017   Clarification from DHS and DOS re  Implementation of Executive Order on Immigration
On Friday  Feb  3  and effective immediately  a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump s week old immigration order from being enforced nationwide
Following the decision  the Department of Homeland Security said it has suspended all actions to implement the president s immigration order  The department will resume inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the executive order  according to a DHS statement
Meanwhile  the State Department said it has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the travel ban so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled
According to Customs and Border Protection  individuals who had their visas physically canceled as a result of the executive order will not need to reapply for a new visa  Absent any other admissibility issues  those individuals will receive an I 193 waiver  Application for Waiver of Passport and or Visa  upon arrival to the U S  For those traveling by air  airlines have been instructed to contact Customs and Border Protection to receive authorization to permit boarding
On Sunday  Feb  5  a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore the executive order
We continue to monitor all legal and implementation decisions related to the executive order and will provide information as it becomes available
February 1  2017   Travel Alert Under President Trump s Immigration Executive Order
On January 27  2017  President Trump issued an Executive Order suspending immigrant and non immigrant admissions to the U S  for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran  Iraq  Libya  Somalia  Sudan  Syria  and Yemen  The Executive Order did not specifically categorize what categories of  individuals   i e   the definition of  individuals from   are subject to the ban  This broad generalization has led to widespread confusion at ports of entry across the U S   but since then the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has stated that travelers will be treated according to the travel document  passport  they present at the border  See https   www dhs gov news 2017 01 29 protecting nation foreign terrorist entry united states
Federal judges in several jurisdictions issued court rulings to stay the terms of the Executive Order that would have led to the removal of foreign nationals who arrived in the U S  with a valid visa or status as a lawful permanent resident  green card holder   These stays remain in effect but may be temporary  These court orders also do not apply to airports with pre clearance facilities  Dublin   Shannon  Ireland  Aruba  Freeport   Nassau  The Bahamas  Bermuda  Abu Dhabi  United Arab Emirates  and Calgary  Toronto  Edmonton  Halifax  Montreal  Ottawa  Vancouver  and Winnipeg  Canada   Nationals of the seven affected countries should avoid flying into the U S  from these airports  These court orders do not mean that anyone arriving with a visa is guaranteed entry  People with a non immigrant  temporary  visa from those 7 countries will be denied entry unless they can show that their admission is in the national interest and they do not pose a security threat
Citizens of the affected countries who hold dual citizenship with the U S  should not be directly affected  Non U S  citizens who hold dual citizenship with the affected countries and one other foreign country may be subject to the ban  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant deemed a threat to national security or public safety
This ban may include individuals who have traveled to one or more of the designated countries as well  even if they do not hold a nationality of one of the designated countries  Additional screening for those who have been in these countries should be expected  including the search and examination of luggage  mobile phones  computers  and electronics  including social media pages for any anti American communications or posts
Green card holders returning to the U S  after a short time abroad have the legal right to return to the U S   barring exceptional circumstances  On January 29  2017  the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that  the entry of lawful permanent residents  is in the national interest
Further  U S  Embassies and Consulates across the world have been instructed not to issue any non immigrant or immigrant visas to persons from the affected countries  consistent with the Executive Order  Also  individuals from one of the affected countries who have a pending immigration petition or application with U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  may experience delays in the adjudication of their cases
The Executive Order also contemplates that additional countries could be added to the banned list   Accordingly  until more information becomes available  and given the possibility of a change in government policy that could go into effect immediately  all foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the United States  We recommend that international students and scholars should not travel outside of the U S  without speaking with an advisor at the Office of Global Services  OGS  and or seeking advice from personal legal counsel who can review individual circumstances for potential available options or possible relief from the consequences of the Executive Order  The OGS can provide you with a list of personal immigration attorneys and a list of pro bono service providers
The OGS is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the university to offer resources and support for international students and scholars
Joseph Aoun  President of Northeastern University  sent a message to the entire Northeastern community on January 28  2017  stating   Let us strengthen our resolve to be a welcoming community that embraces the immeasurable benefits of diversity and inclusion  All in our community especially those who feel vulnerable as a result of this new paradigm should feel safe and secure at Northeastern  We  the leadership of the university  stand with you and will pursue every means available to safeguard each of you students  faculty  and staff
This alert is not legal advice  We will continue to provide updated information and guidance as it becomes available

Application Process
To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U S   F 1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS  All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed  approved  and determined to be integral or required for degree completion  by the appropriate advisor  co op coordinator  or SEVIS contact
Step 1  Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e form
The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e form  The documents the student will need include
Electronic I 94   Class of Admission  must be F 1 and  Admit Until Date  must indicate  D S
Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization
When the student has submitted the e form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e form
Step 2  Secondary approver reviews student s CPT e form submission
The Secondary Approver  academic advisor  co op coordinator  or SEVIS contact  who receives the application will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion  If approved  the Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS
If the Secondary Approver does not approve of the request  they will email the student directly regarding their decision
Step 3  OGS reviews completed CPT e form submission
Upon receipt of the completed e form from the Secondary Approver  OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days   OGS will examine the student s documents to determine if they meet all F 1 eligibility requirements for CPT  OGS may place the request on hold and email the student advisor for more information or approve deny the CPT request
Processing times may be variable depending on the time of year
Step 4  Student receives updated I 20 with CPT recommendation
If your CPT request is approved  OGS will send the I 20 electronically to the student s Northeastern University email  You are advised to
Review your I 20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete
Print and sign your I 20
Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I 20
Updating or changing your CPT authorization

Video  Staying in Status on CPT
How CPT affects OPT eligibility
If an F 1 student exceeds 364 days of full time CPT  more than 20 hours per week at a degree level bachelor s  master s or doctorate   they will lose their eligibility to apply for OPT at that degree level
When counting CPT days  every day between the start and end date of CPT counts  including the start and end dates   The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization  not the days the student actually worked  This means even if it was a weekend  holiday  vacation etc   it still counts if the student had CPT authorization
It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full time CPT days have been used per degree level  Students can use previously issued I 20s to document this  Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e form
Part time CPT  20 hours per week or less  does not accrue time towards the 364 day calculation
Students who require more than 364 days of full time CPT at a degree level to complete their degree program are not in violation of their F 1 status  however they will lose OPT eligibility for the same degree level
OGS does not keep track and communicate if students will be exceeding the 364 day mark when students are requesting CPT authorization  Students must keep this in mind when requesting CPT authorization
Please Note  CPT is a benefit of F 1 status  not a guarantee  While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility  CPT authorization is directly tied to a student s academic curriculum  Therefore  the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study  as well as F 1 federal regulations  Simply because an F 1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization

Change of Status and Transfer Students
Change of status
Full time students who are applying to change their immigration status to F 1 within the U S   application through USICS  or by traveling  via consular processing  may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits  such as Curricular Practical Training  CPT   as long as the student has maintained full time F 1 enrollment requirements
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with an advisor to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you  for example a copy of your I 797 approval notice if you changed status within the U S
Transfer students
International students with Active F 1 records  who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University  and maintained status  may be able to use accrued time towards the one academic year requirement from the previous institution
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with an advisor to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available  for example a copy of your official transcript and previous I 20
Please note  if you transfer to Northeastern on an initial I 20  your one academic year accrual resets as an initial student

Visa Application Outcomes
Approval
Congratulations  The majority of F 1 visa applicants are approved  You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after  They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you
Denials
Although F 1 visa denials are rare  the most common visa denial is under 214 b   which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent  and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country  family  job  education  property  that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S  and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post completion OPT or STEM OPT
The F 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions and is typically not a document driven process  Therefore  when an F 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b   Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial
If your F 1 visa application is denied under 214 b   you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer  Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F 1 visa  but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials
Administrative Processing
The outcome of some F 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g  or what is commonly referred to as  Administrative Processing   Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months  In these cases  the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information  or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing  Please note that this is not a visa denial  You should follow the instructions listed on the 221 g  notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy
If the 221 g  requires any information directly from Northeastern  please contact OGS by calling  1 617 373 2310  You will be instructed to share the 221 g  notice with an OGS advisor for further review
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing
Expedited Visa Appointments
U S  Embassies Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F 1 visa interview date if your I 20 program start date is within 60 days  and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date
The process to request an expedited F 1 visa interview varies by location  You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview  or on their online appointment scheduling site  You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment  such as your I 20 showing a program start date within 60 days
Please note  You must first submit the online visa application form  DS 160   pay the application fee  and schedule the first available interview appointment  Only at this point will a consular section consider your request for an expedited appointment
Entering the U S
When preparing for your arrival to the U S   you should plan your travel according to the information provided by your college  According to immigration regulations  F 1 student visa holders can enter the U S  up to 30 days prior to the program report date on the I 20
Students transferring to Northeastern University in F 1 status from another institution or changing their degree level at Northeastern may stay in the U S  or travel between programs  And  they may enter the U S  more than 30 days before the new program start date listed on your I 20
Documents to Bring When Entering the U S
Valid passport with an official F 1 visa stamp
Your original I 20 issued by Northeastern University
I 901 SEVIS fee receipt
Financial documents
Admissions letter
At the U S  port of entry  you will be required to present your passport and I 20 to the immigration officer who will stamp your passport  In most cases  the officer notes  D S   Duration of Status  on your passport pages  This means you are allowed to stay in the U S  for the length of time indicated on your I 20  provided that you maintain full time enrollment and a valid F 1 visa status
Ensure your passport is properly stamped before exiting the immigration inspection area  Do not enter the U S  in visitor status  B 1 B 2  WT  or WB   This status does not permit full time study in the U S
After your arrival  print your Admission  I 94  number at cbp gov I94 and keep a copy of all travel documents  I 94 information  F 1 visa  and I 20  for your personal records  Ensure your I 94 print out contains the correct information  including F 1 visa status and  Duration of Status

ABOUT THE PROGRAM
The mission of the Office of Global Services  Global Student Mentor Program is to support incoming international students as they transition to college life at Northeastern and to the culture of the United States  to foster engagement with the Northeastern community  and to improve resource utilization

Scam alert   imposter calls
If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation  beware  Hang up and report it
Here s how it works
A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number  When you answer  the person on the phone poses as a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer  The scammer  or scammers  will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process  Then  they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information  demand payment  and threaten you with deportation  arrest  or other negative consequences if you do not comply
The scammer will then order victims to make a payment   and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card  gift card  voucher  money order or make some other wire transfer  money exchange  payment or withdrawal   Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides

Guidelines on Maintaining Status
The goal of the Office of Global Services  OGS  is to support you in achieving your personal  academic  and professional goals during your time in the U S  As an international student with F 1 or J 1 nonimmigrant student status  in addition to the challenges of attending a degree program in a foreign country and navigating intercultural differences  you have the added responsibility of maintaining your F 1 or J 1 student status to remain in the U S  and successfully complete your degree
While it is your responsibility to maintain your status  the OGS is here to help guide you to understand the U S  government s regulations and procedures  One of the first ways to learn more about these rules and regulations is through our International Student Orientation  Due to the complexity of U S  immigration regulations  we recommend that you contact our office directly for advising on your F 1 J 1 student status  rather than relying on indirect information from other sources  such as friends or the Internet
U S  federal government regulations require all F 1 and J 1 international students to maintain valid nonimmigrant status  We recommend that you reference the information on this webpage often during your time in the U S  to ensure you are meeting all requirements to maintain your status
Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information  Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements
F 1 Students  Please also review the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on the Study in the States website regarding maintaining F 1 status
Maintaining Lawful F 1 J 1 Status
As an F 1 or J 1 student  you must meet certain obligations in order to maintain lawful immigration status  Maintaining status is necessary in order to receive the benefits of F 1 or J 1 status  such as employment authorization and program extension  and can be crucial to a successful application for a change or adjustment of non immigrant status in the future  Failure to maintain your non immigrant status can result in serious problems with immigration and could lead to deportation from the U S
Consequences of Not Maintaining Your Status
If you fail to maintain your F 1 J 1 status  your legal permission to remain in the U S   utilize the F 1 or J 1 status benefits  such as practical training and employment  as well as your ability to return to the U S  in the future  may be impacted  This also applies to your accompanying F 2 J 2 dependents  status
If you think you may have violated your visa status  please immediately contact OGS  who will schedule an appointment with you to discuss your situation and your options  The options for regaining F 1 status after a status violation are outlined on the OGS website
General Requirements
Click each topic below for more information
Immediately open and carefully read any emails you receive from  email protected   the Office of Global Services email

Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk spam folders for any missed emails from OGS
Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F 1 J 1 status
Report Any U S  Address or Phone Number Changes
F 1 and J 1 regulations require that you report any change to your U S  phone number or U S  local address within 10 days of the change
OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System  SEVIS  record  These changes are not reflected on your I 20 DS 2019 and do not require issuance of a new document
Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account
Graduated students on post completion OPT  STEM OPT  or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS
Keep Copies of all Immigration Related Documents  I 20s  DS 2019s  etc
OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents  as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents
Save each immigration document you are issued during your F 1 J 1 status  You may need them in the future
to document your employment history and your compliance with U S  immigration regulations
for applications for immigration benefits to U S  Citizenship   Immigration Services  USCIS  or future visa applications to Department of State
For electronically issued I 20s  you must print and sign at the bottom of Page 1  We recommend you take a photo or scan a PDF of the signed document
Students on the STEM OPT Extension  please keep copies of all fully executed Forms I 983 that you complete with your STEM employers  including all 12 month and final evaluations on Page 5

Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the OGS website
Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date
Keep your passport valid at all times  The passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future on the day you return to the U S  from a trip abroad
Your F 1 J 1 visa may expire while you are inside the U S  You only need to renew your F 1 J 1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U S  and need to return
Keep your I 20 or DS 2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date  Remember that your I 20 DS 2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record  and if things change  you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated
Extend your I 20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date
In the event of change of academic program or level  update your I 20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations  see the  Change of Degree Level  section below
Notify OGS if you decide to finish your degree online from overseas  stop your program earlier than anticipated  or end an authorized period of CPT OPT STEM OPT earlier than anticipated and depart the U S
Understand Your  Grace Period  After Program Completion
F 1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 60 day grace period starting the day after their I 20 program end date
J 1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 30 day grace period starting the day after their DS 2019 program end date
During the grace period  students can remain in the U S  to travel or prepare to depart the U S  Any on campus employment must stop as of the I 20 DS 2019 program end date
F 1 students are eligible to transfer out during the grace period if accepted to another U S  SEVP certified institution  J 1 students are not eligible to transfer out during the grace period
F 1 and J 1 students are no longer eligible for program extension  change of degree level  or to apply for post completion OPT or post completion AT during the grace period
If you have not requested OPT AT or received approval to transfer out  and you depart the U S  during the grace period  your SEVIS record will be completed and you are no longer eligible to re enter on your current I 20 or DS 2019
Study Requirements
Click each topic below for more information
Make Normal Academic Progress and Stay in Good Academic Standing
Review the academic requirements  academic policies  and minimum GPA requirements of your academic program and adhere to all requirements
Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation  dismissal  suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full time enrollment and your F 1 J 1 status
If you are academically dismissed  please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options
Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework
Maintain Full Time Enrollment
You must maintain full time enrollment each academic term  except during designated vacation periods  and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study
Full time enrollment is as follows
Undergraduate  minimum of 12 credit hours per term
Graduate  minimum of 8 credit hours per term  9 credit hours per term in a 3 credit enrollment system
Graduate students who hold an assistantship  minimum of 6 credit hours per term
International students enrolled in NU Immerse Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs
Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies  CPS
The same rules regarding maintaining full time enrollment  as explained above  apply to F 1 students in the College of Professional Studies  CPS   but there are important differences in program delivery   Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions  A and B  but still count as one full academic term  CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on ground courses throughout the entire term  For instance  F 1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term
F 1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility
Please note  if F 1 students need to withdraw drop from a course  they must withdraw drop from the additional online course and not any of the on ground core courses in order to maintain full time enrollment
Maintain On Ground Presence in Classes
Students must maintain on ground presence throughout the academic term  At Northeastern  there are four different defined instructional methods  Traditional  Hybrid  Live Cast  and Online  The traditional format for courses is fully on ground and meets the F 1 on ground presence requirements  Hybrid courses and Live Cast courses meet the F 1 on ground presence requirements  However  the combination of all hybrid courses plus one online course toward the full time enrollment requirement is not acceptable for maintaining the F 1 on ground presence requirements
J 1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full time on ground requirements
You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar s website
ONLINE LIMITATIONS
The U S  federal government does not look favorably on F 1 students participating in online courses and imposes limitations on online course enrollment
In general  within minimum full time credit requirements  F 1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of
one 3 credit online course  or
one 4 credit online course in a 4 credit enrollment system
up to three credits total for 1 credit courses  i e   three 1 credit courses  or one 2 credit course and one 1 credit course
Note  Students in NU Immerse Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full time on ground requirements
Once F 1 students have met the minimum full time on ground requirements  they may enroll in additional online or hybrid courses if needed desired
It is important that students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses  so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment
Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads
With minor exceptions for non required summer terms and your final term  you must maintain full time enrollment and should not drop below a full time courseload unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance
Students should not take a reduced course load or a non medical leave of absence without discussing these options and obtaining authorization from OGS before the start of the term or before dropping any course s  that would drop below full time enrollment
Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics
Request a Leave of Absence in Advance
If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence  you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance
Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS  There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave
Follow Requirements for Study or Research Abroad
Study Abroad  If you are approved for a university approved study abroad experience through the Global Experience Office  you must submit a Study Abroad I 20 request to OGS
You are required to maintain full time enrollment in order to maintain your F 1 immigration status while studying abroad  Any changes in enrollment during your study abroad program could affect your ability to return to the U S  Please refer to the OGS website for more information
Research Abroad  To be approved by OGS for research abroad  you must maintain your full time registration status at Northeastern University  Additionally  your overseas research project must be required to complete your degree  Please refer to the OGS website for more information
Notify OGS of Any Change in Program or Degree Level in Advance

Once your request is reviewed and processed by OGS  you will receive a new I 20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new program information  You will not be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree
If you are currently in a Master s program and you are changing from one Master s degree program to another Master s degree program  either after completing the first  or without completing   please see Change of Degree Level information above
Transferring to Another U S  School
If you are an F 1 student who would like to transfer your SEVIS record from Northeastern University to another SEVP certified institution  you should review the Transferring Out page of the OGS website and must submit a transfer out request to OGS so that we can release your SEVIS record
To have your SEVIS record transferred to your new institution  you must continue to maintain your F 1 student status per federal regulations  You may request that our office transfer your SEVIS record prior to the end of your program at Northeastern  but the date that your new university receives your record should occur after you have completed your program or after your last date of attendance
Please Note  If you have already completed your program  you must be sure to request your transfer out within your 60 day grace period
Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree Program Early
F 1 students in their final term  even if it is earlier than their current I 20 end date  should review the Final Term page of the OGS website and submit the Intent to Complete eForm linked on that page
PLEASE NOTE  Even if your current I 20 has remaining time  if you will be finishing your degree program early  you must notify OGS in advance so this can be updated  Remaining in the U S  without full time enrollment or taking other action to maintain extend status even if your I 20 is still valid is not considered maintaining status
If you are in your final term and are planning on applying for post completion OPT or AT  your program end date will be adjusted accordingly if needed when OGS processes your request
Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree Program Later Than Expected
If you need additional time to complete your degree requirements  beyond your current I 20 or DS 2019 end date  you must apply for a Program Extension
To maintain your status  you must apply for this extension before your current I 20 or DS 2019 program end date
You can find more information about the Program Extension process on the OGS website

What is H 1B Status
The H 1B is temporary employment authorization that is used for nonimmigrant individuals in a specialty occupation  In order to become eligible for H 1B status  an employer must sponsor an individual and submit a petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS
Each year  the U S  Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has a limit  cap  of 65 000 new H 1B visas for individuals with a bachelor s degree or higher being sponsored by a cap subject employer  20 000 additional H 1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master s degree or higher earned at a U S  college or university  Some H 1B visas are not cap subject  including but not limited to those employed at institutions of higher education  nonprofit research organizations  or government research organizations  H 1B visas are adjudicated through a randomized system and begin on October 1 for cap subject employers
You can learn more about the H 1B Cap Season here
What is the Cap Gap Extension
The Cap Gap Extension is an automatic extension of F 1 status that may be granted to F 1 students who need to  bridge the gap  between the expiration of their OPT STEM EAD and the start date of their approved H 1B sponsored by a cap subject employer
Because new H 1Bs become effective on October 1 of each year  the Cap Gap Extension allows eligible F 1 students to remain in the U S  between the expiration of their OPT STEM Extension and the start of their H 1B
You can learn more about H 1B status and the Cap Gap Extension here
Cap Gap Extension Eligibility
Please be aware that the responsibility of the Office of Global Services  OGS  regarding H 1B petitions is minimal
As an F 1 student  you may be eligible for the Cap Gap extension if
You have maintained your F 1 status
You are the beneficiary of an H 1B petition that was timely filed by an employer that is cap subject
The H 1B petition requests a start date of October 1st and a change of status inside the U S
If you have applied for the H 1B via consular processing  you do not qualify for the Cap Gap Extension
The Cap Gap Extension is automatically applied to a student s SEVIS record  As such OGS is able to provide proof of the extension only if a student has been deemed eligible by USCIS
If Your H 1B Petition was Filed During Your 60 Day Grace Period
If your sponsoring employer filed the H 1B petition during your 60 day grace period  your Cap Gap Extension will allow you to remain in the U S  until the start date of your H 1B  unless your petition is rejected  denied  or withdrawn   However  your work authorization will not be extended  and you must stop working as of the expiration date on your EAD
Please Note  Once your SEVIS record completes for the change of status to H 1B  your F 1 status has ended  and OGS is not able to  revert  your status back to F 1
You can learn more about eligibility for the Cap Gap Extension here
How can I Request Proof of my Cap Gap Extension
Please fill out this e form  Cap Gap I 20 Request
You will need to provide proof of a qualifying  pending  or  approved  H 1B petition  If you are able to do so  OGS will issue you an updated I 20 reflecting your Cap Gap Extension of status  and extension of OPT STEM work authorization if applicable
Can I Apply for the STEM Extension During the Cap Gap Extension period
OGS DOES NOT advise students to submit an application for the STEM Extension after the expiration date of your OPT EAD  even when a student has received the Cap Gap Extension  It is the experience of OGS and other institutions that applications for the STEM Extension have a very high rate of denial when they are submitted to USCIS beyond the OPT EAD expiration date
If a student chooses to submit an application for the STEM Extension after their Cap Gap Extension has been applied but before their OPT EAD has expired  they are advised to also submit a letter to USCIS informing them of the date discrepancy that may exist between the actual OPT end date and the Cap Gap Extension end date  September 30   The letter should advise the adjudicators at USCIS that if the STEM Extension is approved  it must be approved based on the actual OPT end date  not based on the end date of the Cap Gap Extension  Please email  email protected  to request this letter template
If a student decides to continue on their STEM extension rather than changing to H 1B  they must ensure that the employer requests the withdrawal of the H 1B petition prior to October 1  If this is not done  the H 1B status will begin on October 1 and the student s eligibility for the STEM OPT extension will be cancelled
If a student decides to change to H 1B and not proceed with the STEM OPT extension application  the student should send a letter to the USCIS  requesting that the STEM application is withdrawn
H 1B Reporting
There are many complexities that an F 1 student may experience when changing their status from F 1 to H 1B
If your status has already changed or will be changing from F 1 to H 1B  please complete the H 1B Status Change Reporting e form  An OGS Designated School Official  DSO  will review the request and review your F 1 SEVIS record to ensure any changes are reflected accurately
You should fill out this e form
To report that your H 1B petition for change of status was approved  I 797A Approval Notice from USCIS
To report that your H 1B petition for consular processing was approved  I 797B Approval Notice from USCIS  and you have re entered the U S  in H 1B status
To report that your H 1B petition for consular processing was approved  I 797B Approval Notice from USCIS  but you have NOT re entered the U S  in H 1B status yet
To report that your H 1B petition was withdrawn by your employer
If you received a Request for Evidence  RFE  for your H 1B petition that requires you to provide information related to your F 1 non immigrant status or academic background  please submit the H 1B RFE Response Request e form
If your H 1B petition was denied  please submit the H 1B Denial Notification e form  OGS will review the denial notice to determine if any institutional support from OGS or Northeastern is appropriate
Impact of Changing to H 1B from F 1 Status
If you are approved for H 1B change of status  as of the effective date of the H 1B period  October 1 in most cases for cap subject employers   your F 1 status ends and your SEVIS record automatically completes  Unfortunately  in cases where students lose their H 1B employment  due to layoffs  for example  after they have already changed to H 1B  there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated  Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H 1B status  and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H 1B employment is terminated  and that simply reverting back to F 1 status is often not possible
Students whose F 1 status has or will be changing to H 1B status  or whose H 1B employment has been withdrawn  revoked  or denied  should submit the H 1B Status Change Reporting e form  or H 1B Denial Notification e form  as soon as possible so that OGS may review your case  If your H 1B was withdrawn revoked denied and you have questions related to your F 1 status  please also call OGS at  1 617 373 2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor
If your H 1B Employer Withdraws Revokes Your Petition
Please review the information provided on the USCIS website
If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H 1B effective start date  OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you re otherwise eligible  Please submit the H 1B Status Change Reporting e form so we can review your case
If your employer did not withdraw your H 1B petition until AFTER the approved H 1B effective start date  you are not eligible to have your F 1 SEVIS record returned to Active status  You may have a 60 day grace period during which to find alternative H 1B sponsors or apply for a change of status
Advising on your options for H 1B portability  change of status  or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors  We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options
Please review this additional information provided on the USCIS website regarding options following termination of H 1B employment
If Your Cap Subject H 1B Petition is Denied by USCIS
Please refer to the guidance provided on the USCIS website
If an H 1B petition filed for an F 1 student with a cap gap extension is denied  rejected  revoked  or withdrawn  the student will have the standard 60 day grace period  from the date of the notification of the denial  rejection  revocation  or withdrawal of the petition  to depart the United States
The 60 day grace period does not apply to an F 1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation  misrepresentation  or fraud  In such cases  the F 1 student is ineligible for cap gap extension of status and the 60 day grace period  Similarly  the 60 day grace period and cap gap extension of status does not apply to an F 1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation  fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval  In both of these instances  students are required to immediately leave the United States

Scam alert   imposter calls
If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation  beware  Hang up and report it
Here s how it works
A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number  When you answer  the person on the phone poses as a U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer  The scammer  or scammers  will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process  Then  they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information  demand payment  and threaten you with deportation  arrest  or other negative consequences if you do not comply
The scammer will then order victims to make a payment   and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card  gift card  voucher  money order or make some other wire transfer  money exchange  payment or withdrawal   Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides
If you receive a call like that  hang up immediately  We will never ask for any form of payment over the phone or in an email  If we need payment  we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment  Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services official  In general  we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area
Steps you can take
Please report any suspicious call or e mail to the Office of Global Services
If you have been a victim of this telephone or email scam  please report it to the Federal Trade Commission  If you receive a suspicious email or voice message and are not sure if it is a scam  forward it to the the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services webmaster at   email protected    They will review the messages received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate  Visit the Avoid Scams Initiative for more information on common scams and other important tips

Correcting Status
We understand that mistakes happen  Learn about what options may be available to correct your F 1 status and continue your studies on campus
J 1 Student Intern Requirements
The Office of Global Services  OGS  works with J 1 student interns to provide the guidance and support they need in maintaining their status  such as attending orientation  checking in on campus  health insurance  and social security numbers
Reduced Course Load
F 1 and J 1 students must enroll in and maintain a full time course load  however  federal regulations allow international students to reduce their course load in certain limited academic circumstances
Summer Term
At Northeastern  classes run year round  However  not all students are required or choose to study during the summer term  Whether you plan to study or travel  it is important to maintain your status in the summer
Final Term
Some students do not have enough course requirements left in their final term to count as a full course load  Students in this situation may be allowed to enroll in less than a full course load if certain criteria are met
Program Extension
If you are unable to complete your program of study before the program end date on your I 20 or DS 2019  you must apply to OGS for a program extension at least 30 days before the program end date on your current I 20 or DS 2019

Please note  this only applies to F 1 students who submit a paper based application to USCIS for Pre Post Completion OPT or the STEM OPT Extension  it does not apply to online submissions of applications for employment authorization   You can find the edition date on the bottom left hand corner of each page of the document  You may begin using the 10 31 22 edition of the Form I 765 immediately  though USCIS will continue to accept the 07 26 22  05 31 22  and 08 25 20 editions until January 2  2023
filed under  Important Updates
On July 12th  the USCIS implemented a feature on I 765 applications called  myProgress  that will eventually allow OPT STEM applications to see more detail about their pending applications  Unfortunately  there was a glitch with this feature showing a biometrics appointment requirement  Please note that students can disregard this as biometrics appointments are NOT currently required for I 765 applicants in the C03B and C03C eligibility categories for OPT STEM OPT  Additionally  the estimated processing times are NOT accurate  as this is taking into account estimated times for all types of I 765 applications  not just OPT STEM OPT
filed under  Important Updates

In June 2023  USCIS announced that they would expand premium processing for applicants filing Form I 539  Application to Extend Change Nonimmigrant Status  and seeking a change of status to F 1  F 2  M 1  M 2  J 1  or J 2 nonimmigrant status  Online filing of Form I 907  Request for Premium Processing Service  will also be available for these applicants

On March 6  2023  USCIS announced that they would expand premium processing to certain F 1 students seeking OPT and the STEM OPT Extension  The premium processing fee is  1 500 and the expected processing time is 30 calendar days
Starting on March 6  2023  those who have pending form I 765 applications with USCIS may submit a supplemental I 907 request for premium processing
Starting on April 3  2023  all new submissions of the form I 765 may be submitted with an accompanying I 907 request for premium processing
Learn more about how to request premium processing here
Notes from the Office of Global Services
Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS  OGS is unable to assist students with the application process
Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time
OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost  We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS

How Students Fall Out of Status
An F 1 student may fall out of status for a violation of F 1 federal regulations
There are many reasons why a student may fall out of status  including but not limited to
Dropping below full time enrollment without prior authorization
Enrolling in too many online courses
Not maintaining on ground presence
Letting the I 20 program end date expire without requesting a program extension in a timely manner
Working without authorization from the Office of Global Services  OGS
Taking a leave of absence without permission from the college and OGS
Not making normal and continuous progress towards the completion of their program

Administrative Processing   Visa Denials
Administrative Processing   Visa Refusals
Although most J 1 visa applications are approved  the outcome of some J 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g  or what is commonly referred to as  Administrative Processing   In these cases  the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information  or whether the case requires additional administrative processing  Please note that this is not a visa denial  Additionally  for J 1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields  your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing  This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time
You should follow the instructions on the 221 g  to provide any requested information or documentation  If the 221 g  requires any information directly from Northeastern  or if the 221 g  will delay your arrival to the U S  to start your J 1 program  please contact  email protected
Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing
Visa Denials
Although J 1 visa denials are rare  the most common visa denial is under 214 b   which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent  and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country  family  job  education  property  that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S  and instead will return home after their J 1 program
The J 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions  and is typically not a document driven process  Therefore  when a J 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b   Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial
If your J 1 visa application is denied under 214 b   you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer  You can apply again for the J 1 visa  but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial
You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials
If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U S  to begin or continue your J 1 program  please email your Northeastern HR contact   faculty supervisor  and copy  email protected  to notify us that you will not be starting your program

Complexities of volunteering
If you are interested in volunteering  you must be aware of relevant F 1 and J 1 regulations  so you and the organization do not violate any rules regarding employment authorization  F 1 and J 1 students who are working off campus must be authorized before engaging in the employment  Without proper authorization  off campus employment  including some volunteering  would be considered a violation of your F 1 or J 1 requirements  The consequences may include loss of your F 1 or J 1 status in the U S  making it difficult to reacquire lawful status within the U S  If you are considering engaging in a volunteering opportunity  please make an appointment with an OGS adviser before making plans to begin any activity
Volunteering vs  Unpaid Internship
There is a difference between volunteering and engaging in an unpaid internship
Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature  without remuneration or any other type of compensation  F 1 and J 1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria  For example  it is permitted for F 1 and J 1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter  charitable food pantry  or American Red Cross
Unpaid internships  on the other hand  do not usually qualify as  volunteer  activity  Internships  both paid and unpaid  are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern s major field of study  Therefore  F 1 and J 1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships
The Department of Labor in the U S  has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship  please see here  the  Primary Beneficiary Test  outlined on the Department of Labor s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment
Because of the consequences of unauthorized employment  we caution all F 1 and J 1 students to consult the Office of Global Services when considering engaging in an unpaid internship or volunteering opportunity  Please make an appointment with an OGS advisor before making plans to begin any activity
U S  Department of Labor s definition volunteering
The Department of Labor is concerned both with the protection of jobs for U S citizens  and with the prevention of exploitation of workers  They have created laws to ensure employment that should be paid is not done for free  While both you and the employer may be happy with an unpaid arrangement  for example  you may be eager to work even on an unpaid basis in a company in order to gain job experience   this may be considered an unfair arrangement in cases where the work is normally performed by a paid person and both the company and the employee are benefiting from the employment
How to determine whether an activity is truly volunteering and does NOT require work authorization
Employment authorization is NOT required when the work performed can be considered volunteering  To be considered volunteering  the work performed by the individual must meet the following criteria
No compensation or expectation of compensation
The volunteer cannot displace a genuine employee and the services provided by the volunteer should not be the same services for which he or she was previously paid and or expects to be hired and paid for in the future
Services are performed for a non profit charity and the work is  charitable  in nature
Services are performed for a state or local government agency and there is a  civic  purpose to the work
Volunteering at Northeastern
If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern  please review this guidance from Northeastern University Office of General Counsel
Due to the complexity of U S  labor laws  all university departments  who want to have students volunteer within their department  are advised to thoroughly review this resource  If they have further questions on whether or not the engagement is considered volunteering  they should check directly with the Office of General Counsel
