Failure to Report
There typically are no immediate consequences for failing to submit the validation reports  However  there are two potential consequences for missing these reporting requirements
An automatic system termination of your SEVIS record for  Failure to Report While on OPT  is possible  This decision is at the discretion of USCIS SEVP officials  Note  OGS will NOT terminate your record due to a missed validation report
USCIS SEVP may question your failure to submit validation reports during an application for future immigration benefits  e g  H 1B   Your attorney would be advised to assist you with these inquiries
Even if you know that you missed the deadline and that your STEM Validation e form will be denied  the OGS recommends submitting the e form anyways as evidence that you made an effort to comply with the reporting requirements
