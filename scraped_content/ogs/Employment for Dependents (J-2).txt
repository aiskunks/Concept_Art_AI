Overview
J 2 dependents who enter the U S  in J 2 status and are currently present in the U S  are eligible to submit an application to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  USCIS  for an Employment Authorization Document  EAD  in order to work in the U S
The processing time for EAD card applications varies  and can take up to 3 months  The application cannot be submitted until the J 2 dependent has entered the U S  in J 2 status  and can only be submitted while the J 2 dependent is physically present in the U S
The EAD card will typically be issued to match the length of the J 1 s DS 2019  If the J 1 principal extends their DS 2019  and the J 2 would also like to extend their work authorization  they will need to submit a new I 765 application to USCIS to renew the EAD  J 2 dependents are only authorized to work during the dates authorized on their EAD card
Both part time and full time work are permitted using a J 2 EAD card  however any income earned through J 2 employment should not be for the intention of supporting the J 1 principal  J 2 dependents are encouraged to include a support letter  written by themselves to USCIS  with their EAD application to clarify how prospective future employment will not be used for these purposes
