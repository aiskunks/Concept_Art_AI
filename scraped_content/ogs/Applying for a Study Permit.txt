What is a Study Permit
A Study Permit is the immigration document issued by Immigration  Refugees and Citizenship Canada  IRCC  that provides permission for an international student to study in Canada  This permit is your status document while you are studying in Canada and you must make sure to meet the requirements of your study permit  See here for more information about the conditions under a study permit
It is your responsibility to ensure that your Study Permit is valid for the duration of your academic program in Canada
If you are from a country that requires an entry visa  TRV  OR an eTA  this will be issued for you upon approval of your study permit   you do not make a separate application for a travel visa  On approval  you will be given a visa or eTA and a letter of introduction to travel to Canada and you will be issued your study permit upon arriving at the Port of Entry in Canada
