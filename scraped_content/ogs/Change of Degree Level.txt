After the 60 days  if no action is taken on your SEVIS record  the record will automatically complete  If you do not submit your CDL request in a timely manner  you will no longer be eligible for a CDL I 20  and will need to depart the U S  immediately and request a new Initial I 20 to return for the new degree program
Please also note that the start term for your new degree program must be the earliest possible start term  no later than 5 months after you complete or end your previous program
