ABOUT THE PROGRAM
The mission of the Office of Global Services  Global Student Mentor Program is to support incoming international students as they transition to college life at Northeastern and to the culture of the United States  to foster engagement with the Northeastern community  and to improve resource utilization
A peer mentor is a current student who spends time with new students to help them adjust to college life  Both international and domestic students can apply to be peer mentors  The students who receive mentorship are called  mentees
Participating new students will be matched with an OGS Global Student Mentor  The mentor will reach out first over email and introduce themselves and set up the first meeting  Throughout the academic term  mentees will connect with their mentor in person through one on one meetings and group gatherings  These meetings take place in person and at least once per month  Mentees can ask questions and receive advice from the perspective of an experienced Northeastern student  Your mentor will help you to set goals for your experience at Northeastern  Mentees might consider discussing with their mentors
How to access resources on campus
How to join a club or get involved with the campus community
Suggestions for developing college level study skills
How to use public transportation in Boston
Questions about American culture
Feelings of homesickness
It is important that mentees make the same level of commitment as their mentor  This includes being responsive to your mentor and making time in your schedule for regular meetings throughout the whole semester
Northeastern has many different mentorship programs  so please review other options to find which program best supports your interest and needs  The OGS program is dedicated to supporting international students in their cultural transition and academic success  Therefore  we cannot guarantee that your mentor will be a student in your same academic program  If you are interested in peer support specific to your academic program  please consult with your academic advisor to see what may be available  Additionally  this program is not for the purpose of career or workplace networking  though you may want to discuss strategies for professional networking with your mentor
