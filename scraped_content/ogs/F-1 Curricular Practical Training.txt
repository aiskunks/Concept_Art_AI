How CPT affects OPT eligibility
If an F 1 student exceeds 364 days of full time CPT  more than 20 hours per week at a degree level bachelor s  master s or doctorate   they will lose their eligibility to apply for OPT at that degree level
When counting CPT days  every day between the start and end date of CPT counts  including the start and end dates   The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization  not the days the student actually worked  This means even if it was a weekend  holiday  vacation etc   it still counts if the student had CPT authorization
It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full time CPT days have been used per degree level  Students can use previously issued I 20s to document this  Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e form
Part time CPT  20 hours per week or less  does not accrue time towards the 364 day calculation
Students who require more than 364 days of full time CPT at a degree level to complete their degree program are not in violation of their F 1 status  however they will lose OPT eligibility for the same degree level
OGS does not keep track and communicate if students will be exceeding the 364 day mark when students are requesting CPT authorization  Students must keep this in mind when requesting CPT authorization
Please Note  CPT is a benefit of F 1 status  not a guarantee  While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility  CPT authorization is directly tied to a student s academic curriculum  Therefore  the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study  as well as F 1 federal regulations  Simply because an F 1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization
