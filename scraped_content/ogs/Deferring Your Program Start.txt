After your admissions contact in your college  program has confirmed your deferral  you will need to request a new I 20 with a new program start date  This is important because it will 1  prevent your SEVIS record from being cancelled if you are not in the US this term and 2  will allow you to travel with current and accurate documents
Request a new I20
Requests for I 20s for programs starting in Winter CPS 2024 quarter or Spring 2024 semester will be available from OGS in late September or October 2023
If you had previously paid for the I 901 SEVIS fee  you will be able to request SEVP to transfer that payment to your new SEVIS record once it has been created
