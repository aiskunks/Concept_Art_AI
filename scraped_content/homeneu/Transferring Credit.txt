Application Information
Transferring Credit
Transfer credit may be available to students who complete advanced examinations in high school or college level courses at an accredited higher education institution
Northeastern will consider credit bearing courses taken at an accredited higher education institution with grades of  C  or higher as reported on an official transcript or certain advanced examinations with qualifying marks for transfer credit
Northeastern does not pre evaluate courses for transfer credit  Once a student is admitted  they are able to have courses evaluated for transfer credit
To have courses considered for transfer credit  Northeastern will first need to receive an official college transcript from an accredited higher education institution  Official transcripts may be sent via electronic exchange or standard USPS mailing to the address below

If you wish to see what courses transfer to Northeastern  please refer to our transfer equivalency database  The database is listed below under  Transfer Equivalency Database   If a course is not listed in the database  it means Northeastern academic departments have not evaluated the course before
After admittance  students may submit full syllabi for courses that do not appear in the transfer equivalency database through the application status check  This will allow Northeastern academic departments to evaluate new courses
Admitted students will also gain access to the myPAWS Degree Audit Review System where the evaluation of transfer credit is posted throughout the transfer credit process
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions facilitates the transfer credit process in partnership with Northeastern academic departments  Course equivalencies in the transfer credit database are used as a guide on how classes at your current or former institution can be transferred to Northeastern  While a course may appear in the transfer credit database below  it does not guarantee that it will transfer into your individual major  You must apply and submit your official transcript of coursework completed to our Office of Undergraduate Admissions before a final determination can be made
P Passing Grade Policy for Spring and Summer 2021 Semester Courses
Northeastern only considers courses for credit in which a grade of C or higher is earned  Courses taken in a pass fail format are not considered for credit with the exception highlighted below
For students interested in joining Northeastern  either as a transfer student or first year student enrolled in a dual enrollment program  we will consider courses for credit in which a pass grade was earned in the spring and or summer 2020 semesters  This is an exception to our policy of not accepting courses for credit taken in a pass fail format and is in response to the burden felt by students newly accessing material in an entirely online format due to COVID 19
Policy for students entering in the fall or spring semesters of the 2021 22 school year
Northeastern will consider courses in which a P Passing grade has been earned for course credit
The course must be credit bearing from the transferring institution to be considered
This will apply to students whose spring and or summer 2021 semesters have moved to full or partial Pass Fail grading
Students must still complete the transfer credit evaluation process and provide syllabi for those classes not listed in Northeastern s transfer credit database
Classes must have a Northeastern course or elective equivalent in order to be eligible for credit toward graduation requirements
