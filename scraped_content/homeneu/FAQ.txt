Early Action is non binding and ideal for students who want to put their best foot forward at an earlier date  The Admissions Committee will not see senior year grades or late fall standardized testing scores

Are there specific course requirements for admission
Students are recommended  at minimum  to complete four years of English  two years of history  two years of the same foreign language  three years of science  and three years of math  Our most competitive applicants will have completed four years of all five major subjects  or perhaps dropped one subject as a senior to double up on equally rigorous courses in another subject  Applicants to the College of Engineering must have taken physics  chemistry  and precalculus
