 Frequently Asked Questions 



 Frequently Asked Questions

 







 Can I study in a part time course in Canada 



 From an Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada IRCC perspective at a minimum students must have part time status with their institution to be considered to be actively pursuing their studies However one of the eligibility requirements for Post Graduation Work Permit is the student must maintain full time status in every academic session Part time course load may affect the student qualifying for for Post Graduation Work Permit 







 How can I prove that I meet the study permit conditions 



 IRCC might ask you to prove you re meeting your conditions as part of a random check or if they have reason to believe you re not meeting them IRCC might ask you for the official documents from the university confirming 

your enrolment status the reason for and start date of any leave you ve taken the date you withdrew from a school or study program the date you were suspended or dismissed from a school or study program the date you stopped studying at the school official transcripts references from people who know you proof from a medical professional confirming the medical need for a leave from your study program document confirming your school has closed and no longer offers your study program any other document an officer finds relevant 







 What if I am academically dismissed or transferring to another institution how this will affect my status 



 Student must stop on off campus work if they stop full time studying including being dismissed from school Students engaging in post secondary studies in Canada are authorized to change institutions or programs of study within the same institution provided they are not limited from doing so by conditions imposed on their study permit However to assess if a student who has changed institutions or programs of study a number of times should be considered to be actively pursuing their studies the officer should consider the student s reasons for the changes In cases where multiple program or institutional changes do not appear to support the expectation that the student is making reasonable progress toward the completion of a Canadian credential the officer may determine that the study permit holder has not fulfilled their study permit condition to actively pursue their course or program of study A student should begin or resume their studies at their new institution within 150 days from the day that they ceased or completed their studies at the previous institution If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days they should do either of the following 

change their status that is change to visitor status or worker status leave Canada 

If they do not change their status or leave Canada they are considered non compliant with their study permit conditions 







 What does non compliant mean 



 Non compliance with study permit conditions may result in enforcement action that is an exclusion order can be issued for non compliance per Canadian Immigration Law Non compliance with study permit conditions or engaging in unauthorized work or study may also negatively affect future applications that are made under the IRPA and IRPR For example a subsequent study permit or work permit may not be issued until a period of 6 months has passed since the cessation of the unauthorized work or study or failure to comply with a condition per Canadian Immigration Law section R221 and subsection R200 3 







 What if I take a leave of absence from my studies how will this affect my status 



 Students may be required or may wish to take leave from their studies while in Canada Office of Global Services Canada does not approve or authorize leave of absence Students who wish to request leave of absence are strongly recommended to familiar themselves with the immigration implications with regard to taking the leave For the purpose of assessing if a student is actively pursuing their studies any leave taken from a program of studies in Canada should not exceed 150 days from the date the leave commenced and must be authorized by their DLI Examples of reasons for leave include but are not limited to the following 

medical illness or injury pregnancy family emergency death or serious illness of a family member change in program of study within the same institution outside a regularly scheduled break dismissals or suspensions dependent on degree of severity postponed program start date see Deferred enrollment for more information 

A student on leave who begins or resumes their studies within 150 days from the date the leave commenced that is the date the leave was granted by the institution is considered to be actively pursuing studies during their leave If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days they should do either of the following 

change their status that is change to visitor status or worker status leave Canada 

If they do not change their status or leave Canada they are considered non compliant with their study permit conditions Students studying at Northeastern University Canadian campuses are advised to work with their Academic Advisor if they wish to take the leave They are also advised to keep a copy of any emails confirmation regarding the authorized leaves that are granted in case they need it for their PGWP application 







 What is maintained status 



 Maintained status formerly called implied status refers to a legal extension of an individual s immigration status while waiting for IRCC to process an application for a new permit to remain in Canada To have maintained status you must submit your application to IRCC for a new permit before your current status expires For continuing students this means that you may be able to continue to study and work if eligible beyond your study permit expiration date as long as you applied to extend your study permit before your previous permit expired
