 Students Studying in The United States Reduced Course Load 

 F 1 and J 1 students must enroll in and maintain enrollment in a full time course load during every required academic term however federal regulations allow international students to reduce their course load due to specific and limited academic or medical circumstances 











 When is a Reduced Course Load RCL Permitted 

The limited exceptions to full time enrollment include 

Medical Conditions Final Academic Term of Study Academic Difficulties 

Students must obtain approval from the Office of Global Services before dropping below full time enrollment Failure to do so will result in a violation of status and may require the termination of your SEVIS record 



 Medical Conditions 

At Northeastern students must work with The Office of Global Services and University Health Counseling Services UHCS to request a Medical Leave of Absence this is referred to as a Medical RCL in SEVIS Please see the Medical Leave of Absence page for more information 



 Academic Difficulties 

Students who are experiencing certain types of academic difficulties as allowed by U S federal government regulations may be eligible for an RCL in their first academic term The reasons allowed for an academic difficulty RCL include 

Improper course placement e g you registered for a course and then you and or the professor discover that a prerequisite requirement is needed Unfamiliarity with American teaching methods Initial difficulty with English language Initial difficulty with reading requirements 

Please note for an Academic RCL 

Failing a class is not a sufficient reason to apply for a reduced course load Students must apply to OGS for a reduced course load before dropping below full time status or before registering for a reduced number of courses Students must still be enrolled in at least 50 of a full time course load and must continue to maintain on ground presence A reduced course load for academic difficulties may be taken only once per academic degree level 

Requesting Authorization for an Academic RCL

Student must complete Part 1 of the Recommendation for Reduced Course Load form Academic Advisor for undergraduate students excluding CPS or Authorized Secondary Approver General Request for graduate students and all CPS students must complete Part 2 of the Recommendation for Reduced Course Load form Student must submit the completed RCL e form to the Office of Global Services 

If the e form does not include a completed Recommendation for Reduced Course Load form it will be denied 

 Wait for OGS approval Students must not drop their courses until OGS has confirmed that the RCL has been authorized Confirmation will be sent via email to the student and registrar 





 Final Academic Term 

Students who are in their final academic term of their program of study may not need a full time course load to complete the requirements for their degree No authorization from OGS is needed in this situation though we do advise students to confirm with their academic advisor that all graduation requirements have been met Please see the Final Term page for more information
