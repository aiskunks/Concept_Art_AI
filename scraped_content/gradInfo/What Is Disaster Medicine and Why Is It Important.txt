Communities of all sizes can face crises that have a significant impact on its citizens and their ability to provide standard services that allow it to function  When these challenges arise  it s vital to have trained professionals who are equipped to handle public health emergencies and mitigate damage  As a result  disaster medicine has become an emerging field to help societies plan for and manage serious situations that could potentially have a devastating impact
If you re unfamiliar with this field  here s an overview of disaster medicine  what types of healthcare providers work in this field  why it s important  and key steps for entering the field
What Is Disaster Medicine
Disaster medicine is a branch of healthcare focused on assessing public health risks  planning for future disasters  and implementing emergency strategies to aid recovery
Disaster medicine covers a wide array of activities around disasters   says Stephen Wood  program director for the extreme medicine certificate program at Northeastern University s Bouv  College of Health Sciences   It can include man made disasters like terrorist attacks or natural disasters like tsunamis and hurricanes
Some additional crises that can warrant disaster medicine include those caused by human error or even equipment failures leading to disasters such as food or water contamination  power outages  and dam failures
Effective disaster medicine requires addressing the various phases of the disaster cycle  including planning  mitigation  response  and recovery  Based on past experiences  response teams do their best to prepare for expected issues and provide emergency medical relief in emergency situations
Where Can You Work in Disaster Medicine
The field of disaster medicine offers diverse opportunities for healthcare providers and other emergency response professionals   There are lots of different organizations people might have an interest in   continues Wood
In addition to these positions  there are plenty of volunteer opportunities available on response teams in areas that suffer from recurring disasters  such as tsunamis  hurricanes  and wildfires  Volunteers are often tasked with gathering and distributing resources  rescuing and communicating with survivors  and cleaning up or rebuilding wreckage
For example  he cites state  or federal based agency teams such as Disaster Medical Assistance Teams as one of the most common career options  These response teams are specialized units that respond to disasters and provide medical support to affected communities on a local  regional  tribal  or national level  In addition  DMAT teams are leveraged at high profile federal events where threats to national security are a concern
For those who want to pursue a career in government  but have more interest on the administrative side  working for government organizations such as Homeland Security  allows you to contribute to policy development  resource allocation  and strategic planning around disaster response  However  these roles often require specialized knowledge in emergency management and public health as well
Wood also recommends various roles in humanitarian organizations  such as Team Rubicon  Volunteering or working for these international organizations gives you the chance to travel  interact with a wide range of cultures  and develop transferable skills that can open the door to other career opportunities in the future
Hospitals also play a critical role in disaster medicine  With a heightened emphasis on emergency training for physicians and nurses  hospitals are trying to prepare their emergency departments for triaging and treating patients during unexpected disasters  Beyond direct care  healthcare facilities and other organizations employ professionals in broader emergency preparedness roles as well  These positions involve developing and implementing strategies to enhance the resilience of communities and healthcare systems in the face of disasters
Disaster Medicine vs  Extreme Medicine
If you re considering a career in working in disaster medicine  there may be additional opportunities in other fields related to disaster response  For example  extreme medicine focuses on providing premium care to patients in extreme environments or situations
I think extreme medicine is more broad in what it encompasses compared to disaster medicine   says Wood  For example  while there is a lot of overlap between the two  those interested in responding to immediate  short lived disasters tend to gravitate toward disaster medicine
There s a lot of crossover between disaster medicine and humanitarian medicine as well   continues Wood  Medical professionals who work with organizations like the Red Cross not only need training in disaster response methods  but they also need strategies to ensure quality care in extreme environments
Despite these similarities though  Wood points out that  extreme medicine involves people that have other interests like wilderness and expedition medicine   Some additional facets of extreme medicine even include dive medicine  space medicine  and cold weather medicine
So extreme medicine is just a really large umbrella where all these things fall under   concludes Wood
Why Is Disaster Medicine Important
In a world that constantly faces adversity from manmade and natural crises  disaster medicine plays an essential role in mitigating the impacts these events can have on communities  With the rise in catastrophic disasters  effectively planning for response to these events has become even more pivotal
We as a culture should always be thinking about and planning for the next disaster   says Wood   And I think we ve seen what happens when there s a failure to respond appropriately to a crisis   Slow response to weather related disasters or a break in leadership communication are all common mistakes that can make a difference in disaster response  In addition  the lack of follow through on protocols or procedures can have a negative impact on response time as well
Think about our response to events like COVID 19 or Ebola   explains Wood  People received training  set up protocols  and then  as soon as those crises were over  those protocols all got put away and collected dust
Examples of successful disaster response  like the events following the Boston bombings  reveal the importance of disaster medicine professionals because the leadership and communication channels implemented ensured that both law enforcement and healthcare professionals understood expectations and responsibilities
It takes people that have an interest in disaster medicine to really ensure those plans are enacted  drills are performed  and protocols are in place   explains Wood
How to Start a Career in Disaster Medicine
If you re passionate about helping communities in crisis and want to pursue a career in disaster medicine  there are steps you can take to discover which roles are a good fit for you  Here s an overview of what you can do to prepare for a career in this exciting field
1  Identify Your Specialty
Disaster medicine encompasses more than just doctors and nurses  so it s beneficial to consider how your current background aligns with various opportunities in the field
A lot of people think that only physicians  nurses  and paramedics are needed in these kinds of events   says Wood   However  it actually requires a lot more specialty
According to Wood  some of these additional specialities including
Safety and security professionals
Physical therapists
Biomedical engineers
Psychologists
While this step is important in narrowing down your career path in disaster medicine  it should also show how many opportunities are available to various professional backgrounds
2  Obtain Additional Education
Even as a healthcare professional  there are aspects of disaster medicine that aren t typically covered in your prior education related to care
For example  emergency response teams deal with stressful situations and work in close proximity to extreme situations like poor weather  infectious disease  or environmental challenges that aren t often covered in a clinical based curriculum   One of the important things about these fields  be it disaster medicine  humanitarian medicine  or doing cold weather or jungle expeditions  is your own personal safety   says Wood  Emergency response specialists have to be well aware of their surroundings  able to evaluate risks on the job  and familiar with safety best practices for whatever situation they re in
It takes a lot to have a successful disaster response team  therefore there are lots of different programs you can take most of them being online   continues Wood  Most of these training programs touch on important topics related to disaster response  such as navigating incident command systems and the disaster response cycle
An excellent option for professionals who want a more holistic education in disaster response is a graduate certificate program  like the one at Northeastern   Through our certificate program and eventually a degree program  we allow professionals to develop the skill set for disaster response  humanitarian response  and working in austere environments
3  Gain Experience in the Field
If you really have an interest in doing this  link up with a DMAT team or a search and rescue team  and get that boots on the ground experience   recommends Wood  Emergency response teams draw upon diverse skill sets  such as logistics  informatics  administration  and emergency management  Therefore  experience required will depend on the specific role you aspire to fulfill
Seasoned professionals in the field are one of your best resources for understanding the everyday responsibilities of jobs you re considering  Getting an opportunity to observe and participate in real life disaster response efforts allows you to build practical skills  gain confidence  and figure out which roles are most engaging to you
If gaining industry experience proves difficult  training programs  like the one offered at Northeastern  include an experiential component that allows students to lean on industry expert faculty   Nothing can replace that experiential learning piece  because you re going to be with professionals and learn from those professionals in a safe environment   says Wood
Take the First Step Toward a Career in Disaster Medicine
Starting a career in disaster medicine requires dedication  flexibility  and specialized knowledge  but this field can be rewarding if you re passionate about saving lives and uplifting communities  Equipping yourself with the practical skills needed to succeed in disaster settings will help you deliver effective support while managing your personal safety
Northeastern University s Extreme Medicine certificate program is designed to train professionals for a career in emergency preparedness  It emphasizes experiential learning through team activities and a case based approach  giving graduates the tools to think critically about real disaster response challenges and possible improvements
