Parent and Family Scholarship
Parent and Family Scholarship
Learning Opportunities that Last a Lifetime
Sometimes a parent or sibling delays his or her own continued education to support a full time undergraduate day student  At Northeastern  thanks to the Parent and Family Scholarship  family members can continue working to achieve their advanced educational goals and receive a 25 percent tuition discount on more than 110 eligible graduate programs
The Parent and Family Scholarship allows Northeastern to showcase its commitment to lifetime learning and career development as one of its core values  We are also committed to making education accessible  providing graduate students at different points in their careers with learning formats and locations that meet their needs
A First of its Kind Benefit
Parents and siblings of full time undergraduate day students are eligible for the Parent and Family Scholarship  To receive the discount  prospective graduate students need to provide the Northeastern ID number of their son  daughter  or sibling who must be currently enrolled at the university as a full time undergraduate day student at the time of their application  Even if the undergraduate day student is a senior  the tuition discount will be applied for as long as it takes to complete the desired graduate program
This discount applies to tuition only  Once enrolled  students are responsible for financing the remaining cost of their degree  If a student is offered other grant aid from Northeastern  he or she will receive the scholarship of higher value  Northeastern reserves the right to review the family size and structure reported by the undergraduate day student in his or her financial aid applications to ensure consistency with the information provided by the Parent and Family Scholarship applicant
Those completing pass through degrees such as Direct Entry Nursing  Freshman Entry Doctor of Education  or a PlusOne accelerated master s program do not qualify for the Parent and Family Scholarship
The Parent and Family Scholarship discount is available to newly enrolled parents and siblings as of January 2016 and onward  For any additional questions regarding the Parent and Family Scholarship  please call 877 634 6865  For a complete list of the more than 110 eligible graduate programs  see below
