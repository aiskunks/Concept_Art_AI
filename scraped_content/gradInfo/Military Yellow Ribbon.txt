Home    Fund Your Education   Yellow Ribbon Program
We re proud to offer the Yellow Ribbon Program with unlimited institutional matching funds from Northeastern  without a limitation on the number of recipients
What is the Yellow Ribbon Program
Northeastern University and the Dolce Center for the Advancement of Veterans and Servicemembers  CAVS  in partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  are honored to offer the Yellow Ribbon Program in conjunction with the Post 9 11 GI Bill
The Yellow Ribbon Program is a provision of the Post 9 11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008  This program allows institutions such as Northeastern University to voluntarily enter into an agreement with the VA to fund tuition expenses that exceed either the annual maximum cap for private institutions or the resident tuition and fees for a public institution  The institution can contribute up to 50  of those expenses  and the VA will match the same amount as the institution
What makes the Yellow Ribbon Program at Northeastern different from other schools
Northeastern has significantly invested in the Yellow Ribbon Program to help post 9 11 veterans and servicemembers meet the cost of continuing or completing their education  Unlike other schools  qualified recipients of the Yellow Ribbon Program will receive unlimited institutional matching funds from Northeastern  without a limitation on the number of recipients
This means there is a potential to have 100  of tuition and mandatory fees covered for eligible post 9 11 veterans and servicemembers
Since 2010 Northeastern has given more than  11 2 million in Yellow Ribbon funding to over 800 students  veterans  servicemembers  and dependents
