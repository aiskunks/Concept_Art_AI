The value of an advanced degree in the social sciences and humanities has been under a lot of scrutiny recently
The reality  however  is that advanced education in these areas is applicable to diverse career options that give you the skills needed to address the world s biggest challenges  For example  while climate change requires various types of scientists  it also requires urban planners  environmental economists  and public policy analysts all of which have a background in the social sciences
If you re considering advancing your education  here s an overview of the value of a graduate degree in the social sciences and humanities  what you can do with it  and why earning a social sciences or humanities degree is worth it
Degree Options
There is a diverse range of social sciences and humanities programs available at all educational levels  and each one can bolster your earning potential  skill set  and marketability
If you re choosing to advance your studies  a certificate program or master s degree is likely the best option since it opens the door to additional educational paths  like a PhD
At Northeastern University s College of Social Sciences and Humanities  for example  certificate programs can be incredibly valuable to your overall education because they can be seamlessly incorporated into a master s level curriculum  Not only that  a certificate can be completed in less time with far less financial commitment  giving you the ability to test out a program topic before committing to a full degree
One of the unique features of an advanced degree in the social sciences and humanities is the broad skill set it provides students  Northeastern s interdisciplinary approach  for example  is incredibly valuable because it can help you better understand how these skills fit into different career paths  Not only that  you ll learn alongside people outside of your discipline
Some of the graduate degrees you can obtain in the social sciences and humanities include
Applied quantitative methods and social analysis  Focuses on studying and addressing vital questions surrounding equity  hierarchy  social organization  and social systems

Urban Planning and Policy  Encourages the development of potential solutions to problems impacting urban environments
Despite the variety of degree programs a social sciences and humanities school offers  the value of this education is nearly the same across the board even for programs that you wouldn t traditionally associate with a master s degree
For example  while a master s degree in history may seem unnecessary  our analysis of job postings data shows that 85 percent of historian job postings prefer or require this level of education
As a result  earning a master s degree in a social sciences and humanities field can be incredibly beneficial to your personal and professional goals  Here s a closer look at the return on investment  ROI  you can expect before you decide to apply
ROI of a Graduate Degree in the Social Sciences and Humanities
For many  the major obstacle to earning a master s degree in any field is cost  According to a 2021 report  51 percent of students dropped out of their higher education program because they couldn t afford it  This doesn t even consider the professionals who weren t willing to invest in their initial enrollment
However  there are several aspects of a social sciences and humanities master s degree that can help you recoup your investment post graduation
According to our analysis of job posting data  professionals with a graduate degree in the social sciences and humanities made a median advertised salary of  81 800 per year in 2022
In addition  graduates from these programs can expect high earning potential long term since these wages have been trending upward by 21 2 percent from 2020 to 2023
It s important to remember that this number varies based on the specific program and career path you choose  though  For example  those pursuing a master s in political science can earn upwards of  125 000 annually  while graduates of advanced economic programs can earn over  105 000 per year depending on the job title
Advancing your education doesn t just increase your salary  It also acts as a valuable stepping stone to advancing your career or even finding a new career path you hadn t anticipated pursuing
What Job Opportunities Are Available
There s a wide range of programs in the social sciences and humanities  It s important to keep in mind that the interdisciplinary aspect of these programs allows you to apply your knowledge to a wide range of positions
However  according to our analysis of job postings data  here are the most job titles of graduates from a social sciences and humanities master s degree program
Social Science Research Assistants
Social Scientists
Political Scientists
Urban and Regional Planners
Economists
Not only are these the most common career paths for graduates from a social sciences master s program  they also predominantly require an advanced education  For example  91 percent of political scientist job postings prefer or require a master s degree  while up to 68 percent of economist job postings prefer or require a master s degree
This isn t to say that you won t be able to find employment without a master s degree  but advancing your education can broaden the positions you re able to apply for and help you stand apart from other applicants  In fact  our analysis of program data found that 38 percent of job postings related to social sciences and humanities preferred or required a master s degree in 2022  If you re serious about a career in a social sciences or humanities field  it s in your best interest to deepen your knowledge with additional education after receiving your bachelor s degree

Our analysis of job postings data in the social sciences and humanities confirms this  spanning several sectors of business  including the government  education  and business consultation  The extensive application of skills learned from these degree programs can apply to almost any industry in some capacity especially if the program emphasizes interdisciplinarity
For example  earning a degree in economics provides opportunities for skills development that s important for a variety of professionals  including journalists  project managers  and executives  While an economics degree focuses on developing technical skill sets like mathematics and economics analysis  it can also enhance valuable soft skills  such as research  data collection  and collaboration
