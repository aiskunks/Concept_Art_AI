For current or aspiring medical professionals  the unique and exhilarating challenges of a career in extreme medicine offer the chance to make an impact on global health while enjoying a life of adventure  Providing critical care in hostile or austere environments  ranging from disaster zones to remote wildernesses  pushes you to test your skills  adaptability  and resilience
If you re excited to learn more about this career path  here s an overview of extreme medicine  the role it plays in public health  and whether it s the right fit for you
How to Provide Medical Care in Extreme Environments
Extreme medicine is the practice of delivering medical care in unconventional and challenging environments  such as conflict regions  disaster zones  remote wildernesses  or extreme weather conditions
It s taking medicine outside of hospitals and applying it to low resource environments   says Professor Mark Hannaford  DSc  founder of World Extreme Medicine  The extreme medicine organization combines traditional healthcare expertise with specialized knowledge of emergency management and wilderness survival so medical professionals can adapt their treatment strategies to different circumstances
We train medical professionals to work in remote  low resource environments  which are at times dangerous   explains Hannaford  This is particularly important in both wilderness and expedition medicine two subsets of extreme medicine where medical professionals have to manage emergency care and search and rescue operations in areas that may be difficult to reach or filled with obstacles  such as rough terrain  poor weather  or avalanches
While the field is all about preparing for a crisis  Hannaford points out that a need for extreme medicine can arise at any time   Anywhere from space  to Antarctica  to climbing on Everest  to refugee camps in Syria  to working in the Ukraine  Anywhere can be an extreme environment given the circumstances   says Hannaford
For example  if you re based in Boston and your vehicle gets stranded in the middle of nowhere in the winter  you too are at risk of getting frostbite and hypothermia  All of a sudden you re going to want somebody who knows what they re doing in those types of environments
It s closer to home than people think  but it s as far away as you can imagine at the same time   concludes Hannaford
The Role of Extreme Medicine in Emergency Situations
Extreme medicine mitigates the negative impact of extreme emergencies by ensuring medical aid reaches isolated communities  inaccessible regions  or disaster stricken areas promptly  In extreme scenarios  conventional healthcare systems may struggle to operate effectively  and healthcare providers must be able to implement better strategies as quickly as possible
In addition  extreme medicine training touches on global trends that are equally important in effective care   With the threats of climate change and overpopulation  we are going to need medics who are able to provide high levels of medical care outside of hospital environments more and more   adds Hannaford
Even areas well equipped with skilled physicians and medical technology can encounter new public health threats they aren t well prepared to manage   COVID is the perfect example   Hannaford remarks   In the UK  the extreme medics were the only people in the hospital systems who had any knowledge of working in a large scale public health environment and who knew hospitals themselves were going to be a hotbed of contagion if they didn t get their systems right
Taking a proactive approach to extreme medicine can prevent secondary health issues and infections  reduce suffering  and increase the chances of successful recovery
As an added benefit  the lessons healthcare professionals learn in emergency situations help improve disaster preparedness methods  train fellow medics  educate the public  and patient outcomes   I think it s also important for mainstream clinical careers and for hospital systems   Hannaford says   because it s producing medics that are able to think on their own and problem solve
The highest priority for extreme medicine professionals is reducing mortality rates  Since it s impossible to predict or prevent every scenario  it s more important for healthcare providers to have the skills and confidence to be resourceful at a moment s notice
You can train as much as you d like and have a plan  but it never turns out how you expect it to   Hannaford points out   But training gives you the ability to problem solve and the security to know you re making decisions based on the latest clinical evidence
No matter what subsect of extreme medicine you choose  it s crucial to be both self sufficient and good at collaborating with others   You are virtually never working by yourself  so you have to be a team player   Hannaford adds   However  you might be the only medic which also makes it quite isolated at times
Medics need to have enough situational awareness to manage their own personal safety while also assessing injuries  identifying risks  and communicating in multidisciplinary teams  And when traditional resources are unavailable  emergency medics have to think quickly to come up with medical techniques that are doable under the current conditions
How to Find a Career in Extreme Medicine
To begin building a career in extreme medicine  aspiring professionals should explore their interest in both medicine and adventurous environments  Understanding the challenges and unique demands of extreme medical work is essential before investing in specialized education  It s also beneficial to compare different types of extreme medicine and common conditions you can expect when working in specific environments
If you don t have a health background  getting medical education in a relevant field is essential  Professionals who already work in healthcare fields can start transitioning by volunteering in emergency response settings or taking immersive extreme medicine courses to build targeted skill sets  For instance  wilderness training programs can provide fundamental outdoor survival skills that are applicable to every other type of extreme medicine
Programs like Northeastern s Graduate Certificate in Extreme Medicine are designed to build upon your existing medical knowledge with skills like crisis management  emergency response  and wilderness preparedness
There are doors that will open as a result of doing this   says Hannaford   We ve seen it happen innumerable times because there s nothing else  This is so new that people will speak to you and could even help you get a foot in the door
Nothing is more useful than hands on field experience and mentorship from seasoned professionals  so it s advantageous to get real world training right away   The more you train  the better you re going to operate  The more you train  the more people you meet  and the more opportunities you make as a result  This means you ll have more friends and colleagues in this space who can help  advise  and support you   says Hannaford
As you research career paths  consider which functions you want to perform as part of an emergency medical team  A variety of medical and allied health roles are available in extreme medicine  such as doctors  nurses  paramedics  dentists  dietitians  and psychiatrists  Aspiring professionals have multiple options for entering the extreme medicine field at different levels  offering flexibility in terms of how and when you want to pursue more education
Networking and being flexible will also come in handy as you explore career options  Building relationships  attending workshops  and practicing in different extreme environments sets you apart as someone who s committed to growing as a healthcare provider   There are lots of areas of medicine that are rewarding  but I think extreme medicine is rewarding because you have grand adventures and have experiences you wouldn t normally have   Hannaford adds
Start a Career in Extreme Medicine
As an emerging field  extreme medicine offers a world of opportunities to medical professionals who are ready to embrace the unknown and have a passion for delivering effective healthcare  Extreme medicine pushes the boundaries of traditional healthcare  and  as a result  practitioners in this field must learn to trust their knowledge and instincts to effectively navigate unfamiliar challenges in healthcare
To achieve that level of confidence and preparedness  extreme medicine professionals need in depth training on navigating harsh environments and an understanding of human psychology of operating in extremes
