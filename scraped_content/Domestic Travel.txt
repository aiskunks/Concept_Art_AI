 Students Studying in The United States Domestic travel 

 As an F 1 or J 1 student there is so much to learn explore and discover in the U S and the Office of Global Services OGS encourages you to do it all Before you do please understand what documents you should carry with you when traveling within the the U S or its territories 











 What you need when traveling in the U S 

 A valid passport The passport should be valid for at least six months after your date of entry to the U S Form I 20 F visa or DS 2019 J visa Print your most recent I 94 which is your arrival departure record

Any family members traveling with you who have F 2 or J 2 visas should carry the same documents Northeastern University requires all students and highly recommends that all faculty and staff enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations into My Travel Plans also called the Travel Registry This allows the university to communicate directly with travelers if unexpected events or conditions create circumstances that might pose health or safety risks In addition it enables on campus resources and external support providers to better respond to students faculty and staff who may need medical or security assistance
