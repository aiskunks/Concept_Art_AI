 Guidelines on Maintaining Status 
 While it is your responsibility to maintain your status  the Office of Global Services is here to help guide you through the complexities of the U S  government regulations and procedures  
      Guidelines on Maintaining Status     
The goal of the Office of Global Services  OGS  is to support you in achieving your personal  academic  and professional goals during your time in the U S  As an international student on with F 1 or J 1 student status  in addition to the challenges of attending a degree program in a foreign country and navigating intercultural differences  you have the added responsibility of maintaining your F 1 or J 1 status to remain in the U S  and successfully complete your degree  
While it is your responsibility to maintain your status  the OGS is here to help guide you to understand the U S  government s regulations and procedures  One of the first ways to learn more about these rules and regulations is through our International Student Orientation  Due to the complexity of U S  immigration regulations  we recommend that you contact our office directly for advising on your F 1 J 1 status  rather than relying on indirect information from other sources  such as friends or the Internet  
U S  federal government regulations require all F 1 and J 1 international students to maintain valid nonimmigrant status  We recommend that you reference the information on this webpage often during your time in the U S  to ensure you are meeting all requirements to maintain your status   
Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information  Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements   
F 1 Students  Please also review the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  on the Study in the States website regarding maintaining F 1 status  
      Maintaining Lawful F 1 J 1 Status     
As an F 1 or J 1 student  you must meet certain obligations in order to maintain lawful immigration status  Maintaining status is necessary in order to receive the benefits of F 1 or J 1 status  such as employment authorization and program extension  and can be crucial to a successful application for a change or adjustment of non immigrant status in the future  Failure to maintain your non immigrant status can result in serious problems with immigration and could lead to deportation from the U S  
          Consequences of Not Maintaining Your Status        
If you fail to maintain your F 1 J 1 status  your legal permission to remain in the U S   utilize the F 1 or J 1 status benefits  such as practical training and employment  as well as your ability to return to the U S  in the future  may be impacted  This also applies to your accompanying F 2 J 2 dependents  status   

If you think you may have violated your visa status  please immediately contact OGS  who will schedule an appointment with you to discuss your situation and your options  The options for regaining F 1 status after a status violation are outlined on the OGS website

Our office will send any important information related to your F 1 J 1 status to your Northeastern email address   
Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk spam folders for any missed emails from OGS  
Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F 1 J 1 status  

                                Report Any U S  Address or Phone Changes                                 
F 1 and J 1 regulations require that you report any change to your U S  phone number or U S  local address within 10 days of the change  
OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System  SEVIS  record  These changes are not reflected on your I 20 DS 2019 and do not require issuance of a new document  
Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account 
Graduated students on post completion OPT  STEM OPT  or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS

All international students with F 1 or J 1 status must complete the mandatory Immigration Clearance at the start of each new program of study  This is a U S  government regulation for students to maintain their non immigrant status  OGS facilitates this process  which is called  online immigration clearance   Students who do not complete the mandatory immigration clearance within the deadline are not maintaining status and are at risk of SEVIS record termination  
Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the OGS website  

                                Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date

Your F 1 J 1 visa may expire while you are inside the U S  You only need to renew your F 1 J 1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U S  and need to return  
Keep your I 20 or DS 2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date  Remember that your I 20 DS 2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record  and if things change  you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated   
Extend your I 20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date  
In the event of change of academic program or level  update your I 20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations  see the  Change of Degree Level  section below

 Study Requirements 

                         Click each topic below for more information                     

                                Make Normal Academic Progress and Stay in Good Academic Standing                                 
Review the academic requirements  academic policies  and minimum GPA requirements of your academic program and adhere to all requirements  
Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation  dismissal  suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full time enrollment and your F 1 J 1 status  
If you are academically dismissed  please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options  
Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework  

                                Maintain Full Time Enrollment                                 
You must maintain full time enrollment each academic term  except during designated vacation periods  and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study  
Full time enrollment is as follows  
Undergraduate  minimum of 12 credit hours per term 
Graduate  minimum of 8 credit hours per term  9 credit hours per term in a 3 credit enrollment system  
Graduate students who hold an assistantship  minimum of 6 credit hours per term 
International students enrolled in NU Immerse Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs 
Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies  CPS  
The same rules regarding maintaining full time enrollment  as explained above  apply to F 1 students in the College of Professional Studies  CPS   but there are important differences in program delivery   Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions  A and B  but still count as one full academic term  CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on ground courses throughout the entire term  For instance  F 1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term  
F 1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility  
Please note  if F 1 students need to withdraw drop from a course  they must withdraw drop from the additional online course and not any of the on ground core courses in order to maintain full time enrollment  

                                Maintain On Ground Presence in Classes                                 
Students must maintain on ground presence throughout the academic term  At Northeastern  there are four different defined instructional methods  Traditional  Hybrid  Live Cast  and Online  The traditional format for courses is fully on ground and meets the F 1 on ground presence requirements  Hybrid courses and Live Cast courses meet the F 1 on ground presence requirements  However  the combination of all hybrid courses plus one online course toward the full time enrollment requirement is not acceptable for maintaining the F 1 on ground presence requirements    
J 1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full time on ground requirements  
You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar s website  
ONLINE LIMITATIONS  
The U S  federal government does not look favorably on F 1 students participating in online courses and imposes limitations on online course enrollment    
In general  within minimum full time credit requirements  F 1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of  
one 3 credit online course  or  
one 4 credit online course in a 4 credit enrollment system  
up to three credits total for 1 credit courses  i e   three 1 credit courses  or one 2 credit course and one 1 credit course  
Note  Students in NU Immerse Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full time on ground requirements 
Once F 1 students have met the minimum full time on ground requirements  they may enroll in additional online or hybrid courses if needed desired 
It is important that students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses  so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment  

                                Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads                                 
With minor exceptions for non required summer terms and your final term  you must maintain full time enrollment and should not drop below a full time courseload unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance  
Students should not take a reduced course load or a non medical leave of absence without discussing these options and obtaining authorization from OGS before the start of the term or before dropping any course s  that would drop below full time enrollment   
Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics  

                                Request a Leave of Absence in Advance                                  
If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence  you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance   
Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS  There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave  

                                Follow Requirements for Study or Research Abroad
