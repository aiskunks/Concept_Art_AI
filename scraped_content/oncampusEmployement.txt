 Students Studying in The United States On-Campus Employment
One of the benefits of the F-1 and J-1 student visa types is eligibility for on-campus employment. There are specific requirements and restrictions for on-campus employment, however, so please be sure to carefully review this page before engaging in on-campus employment.

Overview and Definition
F-1 students enrolled in degree-seeking programs and J-1 degree-seeking and exchange students at Northeastern University are eligible to work on-campus while attending classes. The work does not need to be related to the student’s field of study. Students must maintain legal F-1 or J-1 status while engaging in on-campus employment.
On-campus employment includes:
Work done in the University library, laboratories, residential buildings, administrative offices, or doing research on-campus
Employment based on a fellowship, assistantship, or grant (such as a teaching or research assistantship)
Employment with approved on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as restaurants located in a University-owned building
If you have questions about if something counts as “on-campus” please review the list of eligible on-campus employers below or reach out to OGS directly.

Policies
Students may work up to 20 hours per week while school is in session and more than 20 hours per week during official school breaks (this does not include recesses or days with no class)
Continuing students may exceed 20 hours per week on campus work after the final exam period (which may be later than when final exams take place) is over.
Graduating students are allowed to work until the official last day of university finals. The dates of the finals period are posted in the Academic Calendar. (Check the calendar to confirm the dates for your school)
Students may be eligible to work on-campus while also engaging in Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Pre-Completion Academic Training (AT) if allowed by their department.
Students holding a Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA) should review this page for eligibility/requirements and submit the appropriate request for that type of on-campus employment. Students engaging in an SGA may not work in additional on-campus jobs.
Remote on-campus employment:

F-1 students can participate in remote on-campus employment for a different Northeastern campus located in the U.S. that is not their home campus. F-1 students are not eligible to work remotely for a non-U.S. based Northeastern campus.

Example: An F-1 student at the Boston campus may be a Teaching Assistant for a course taking place at the Seattle campus. However, an F-1 student at the Silicon Valley campus cannot be a Teaching Assistant for a course taking place at the Toronto, Canada campus or other non-U.S. campus.


J-1 students may only participate in on-campus employment at the campus where they are attending classes and is listed as the site of activity on their DS-2019.

I just finished my last final exam; can I work more than 20 hours per week on-campus now? -> Maybe. If you are a continuing student, you can only work more than 20 hours per week on campus after the final exam period (which may be later than when your final exams take place) is over. Check the University Calendar to confirm final exam periods. You can continue to work more than 20 hours per week until the start of the next semester (or for the duration of the summer, if eligible).

Please keep in mind that you can’t work on-campus at the same time that you hold a Stipended Graduate Assistantship (SGA).
I am graduating this semester. What is the last day that I can work? -> You can work until the last day of the exam period; see the University Calendar to confirm this date.

Can I work on-campus if I am transferring in from another university or between degree levels? -> This may be possible if you already have a Social Security Number (SSN). Please check with an OGS advisor to confirm.
