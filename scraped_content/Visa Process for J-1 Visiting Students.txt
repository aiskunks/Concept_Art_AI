 Administrative Processing Visa Denials 

Administrative Processing Visa Refusals Although most J 1 visa applications are approved the outcome of some J 1 visa applications is a refusal under 221 g or what is commonly referred to as Administrative Processing In these cases the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information or whether the case requires additional administrative processing Please note that this is not a visa denial Additionally for J 1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time You should follow the instructions on the 221 g to provide any requested information or documentation If the 221 g requires any information directly from Northeastern or if the 221 g will delay your arrival to the U S to start your J 1 program please contact email protected Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing Visa Denials Although J 1 visa denials are rare the most common visa denial is under 214 b which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non immigrant intent and or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country family job education property that indicate they will not immigrate to the U S and instead will return home after their J 1 program The J 1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer s questions and is typically not a document driven process Therefore when a J 1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214 b Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial If your J 1 visa application is denied under 214 b you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer You can apply again for the J 1 visa but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U S to begin or continue your J 1 program please email your Northeastern HR contact faculty supervisor and copy email protected to notify us that you will not be starting your program
