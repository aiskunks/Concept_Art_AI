 Travel Steps 



Apply for a visa

 Arrange your travel Register your travel 

Register your travel with the University s Travel Registry This is available via MyTravelPlans in the Student Hub or directly through the GardaWorld Travel Security Portal sign in with your Northeastern email address More information on the Travel Registry can be found here and here Contact email protected for travel registry assistance

 Research possible restrictions for the duration of your travel 

Determine what is needed for you to comply with the relevant regulations for your travel e g departure connections customs according to your citizenship s and immigration documentation at each checkpoint Be aware of the specific exit requirements from your point of origin and the entry requirements at any transit points as well as the point of entry in the United States Adhere to airlines COVID 19 safety requirements if there are any 



If in doubt about any information contact the relevant immigration or government authority of the countries of the travel 







 After Landing in the U S 

 Primary Inspection When you arrive at the U S Port of Entry you will first go through Primary Inspection This is where a Customs Border Protection CBP officer will review your documents to determine if you may enter the U S They may also ask you some basic questions Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed Here are some tips 

Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F 1 student or a J 1 exchange visitor when you present your I 20 and F 1 visa or DS 2019 and J 1 visa You will be issued an electronic I 94 which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U S which should be F 1 student status or J 1 exchange visitor status Currency if you or the family members you are travelling carry currency amounting to more than 10 000 you must fill out an additional form to declare this More information can be found here Food items there are restrictions on certain food and agricultural items that are allowed into the US Please reference the CBP website for more details 

Generally this step should not last more than a few minutes Until recently visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports and the CBP officers noted D S Duration of Status on F 1 and J 1 visa passport pages this meant you are allowed to stay in the U S for the length of time indicated on your I 20 or DS 2019 provided that you maintain full time enrollment and a valid F 1 J 1 visa status Many U S airports have discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U S Instead each time you enter the U S the CBP creates an online electronic entry record to record your entry into the U S This is called your I 94 record Scroll down to read Check Your I 94 Record for more information If everything is in order the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and or transfer Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area If the officer has additional questions you may be directed to Secondary Inspection Secondary Inspection Secondary Inspection also called Deferred Inspection allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry It is not a punishment and does not mean that you will be denied entry The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status If additional information regarding your F 1 or J 1 status is needed please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official DSO for F 1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer ARO for J 1 visa holders using the following contact information The operations center is staffed 24 7 for this purpose 

International Safety Office

 Office of Global Services 

 1 617 373 2310 email protected Please see our Contact page for operations hours 



Most importantly ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties More information on Secondary Inspection can be found here 







 Check Your I 94 Record 

 The I 94 is an admission record that contains information about your most recent entry to the U S It is issued to all international travelers who enters the U S with the exceptions of those who are part of a visa waiver program and is updated with each entry you make It contains your basic biographical information as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U S Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US you should retrieve your electronic I 94 record here Note that it may take a few days after your entry for the record to populate You should check and save a screenshot of your I 94 record each time you enter the U S as the I 94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U S Please review your I 94 record for accuracy Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are Class of Admission and Admit Until Date These fields should be filled out as follows 

Class of Admission matches what is listed on your visa stamp Admit Until Date D S This stands for Duration of Status 

Visa status other than F 1 J 1 must be corrected immediately B 1 B 2 WT or WB status does not permit full time study in the U S If anything looks incorrect on your I 94 record please visit this page for more information on how to request a correction 







 Form I 515 or I 515A 

 The CBP officer may issue you a Form I 515A if you are missing paperwork or if they are not able to verify your status This form allows you temporary entrance into the US for up to 30 days during which time you must collect and submit the necessary evidence to the government to be able to remain in the US for the duration of your F 1 or J 1 status If you receive a Form I 515A the Office of Global Services OGS is happy to provide guidance with your response to the government Please complete the Request to Comply with I 515A e form to notify us so that we may best assist Note that an I 515A should not have any negative impact on your status as long as you respond in a timely manner More information on the form I 515A can be found here 







 Departing the Airport 

 Car Service A car service is great way to pre arrange a convenient and safe ride from the airport to your final destination OGS recommends Boston Carriage Click here to visit their website and enter your reservation details Use promo code HUSKY2020 for a 5 discount Tips for using Boston Carriage 

Book your ride in advance as soon as possible to guarantee that there is availability on your date of travel You will receive detailed instructions about where to meet your driver upon your arrival Make sure to build in a 60 minute delay for clearing Customs Border Protection and baggage claim after your flight arrival time Traveling with friends or family Consider booking a van instead of a car so there is enough room for your luggage Expect no contact service to decrease risk of COVID 19 transmission this means all cars are outfitted with a partition between the driver and passenger area the driver will be wearing a face mask and vehicles will be sanitized before after pick up 

Ride Share Apps such as Uber or Lyft 

Download the app before you travel You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver Some airports such as Boston Logan have a designated Ride App pick up area After collecting your luggage from baggage claim follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car Ask your driver to wear a mask and put down the windows for airflow to decrease risk of transmission of COVID 19 

Public Transportation Depending on your final destination public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive 







 Traveling to Northeastern for Commencement 

 International students who graduated in a previous academic term but who want to participate in graduate ceremonies at a later date for example a student who graduates at the end of the fall academic term wants to participate in graduation ceremonies at the end of the spring academic term will have a Completed SEVIS record if they did not apply for Optional Practical Training OPT or continue in a new academic program This means that your F 1 J 1 visa and I 20 DS 2019 are no longer valid for entry to the U S even if they have a future end date as you are no longer enrolled in a program of study 

Do not request a travel signature since you are no longer eligible for this benefit Utilize alternate visas for travel to the U S such as a Visitor Visa or the Visa Waiver Program if you are a citizen of a participating country
