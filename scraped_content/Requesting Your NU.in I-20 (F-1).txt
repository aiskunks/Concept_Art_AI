 You will be issued a new form I 20 for Spring 2024 when you will be matriculated into your degree program International students participating in the N U in program outside of the U S are not eligible for SEVIS transfer from previous institutions because the difference between the end of their high school program and the beginning of their U S portion of the N U in Program is more than five months Please do not ask your high school to transfer your SEVIS record to Northeastern if you are participating in N U in outside of the U S Your I 20 from Northeastern will be a new initial I 20 with a new SEVIS number which means that you will need to pay another SEVIS fee and apply for a new F 1 visa
