accidents of science  Northeastern professor Randall Erb and Ph D  student Jason Bice were working on a product for a university client and wound up with an entirely new class of material Their discovery of an all ceramic that can be compression molded into complex parts an industry breakthrough could transform the design and construction of heat emitting electronics  including cellphones and other radio components  Our research group s lives are very much situated at the bleeding edge of technology   says Erb  an associate professor of mechanical and industrial engineering who heads the DAPS Lab at Northeastern   Things break a lot  and every once in a while one of those breaks turns out to be good fortune  Last July  Erb was in his Northeastern lab with Bice  who has since earned a mechanical engineering Ph D  They were testing an experimental ceramic compound as part of a hypersonic project for an industrial partner when something appeared to go wrong  We blasted it with a blowtorch and  while we were loading it  it unexpectedly deformed and fell out of the fixture   Erb says   We looked at the sample on the floor thinking that it was a failure  Closer examination gave way to a revelation  We realized it was perfectly intact   Erb says   It was just shaped differently  Ceramics tend to fracture  or even explode  from thermal shock when subjected to extreme heat changes and mechanical loading  But their sample had deformed gracefully  We tried it a few more times and realized that we could control the deformation   Erb says   And then we started compression molding the material and found that it was a very fast process  Its underlying microstructure uniquely allows the all ceramic to quickly transmit heat and flow effectively during the molding process  The ceramic can be formed into exquisite geometries and exhibits impressive mechanical strength and thermal conductivity at room temperature  says Erb  whose findings were recently published in Advanced Materials Erb and Bice are developing the product via their startup  Fourier LLC named after the French mathematician Joseph Fourier  who studied heat flow in ceramics two centuries ago  Fourier has received a  50 000 Spark Fund award from Northeastern s Center for Research Innovation  It s unique  Thermoformable ceramics  from what we ve seen and read  don t really exist   Bice says   So it s a new frontier in materials  The new product has the potential to introduce two industry improvements  starting with its efficiency as a heat conductor that can cool high density electronics In general  cellphones and other electronics are fitted with a bulky layer of aluminum  which is necessary to draw heat away from the unit  Our material can be less than a millimeter thick  which presents a low profile solution   Bice says   It can be molded to conform to the surface that you re trying to cool  The phononic crystal based ceramic allows heat to flow without electron transport  says Erb  It doesn t interfere with radio frequencies  RF  of cellphones and other systems  If you put an aluminum heatsink into an RF component  you ve basically introduced a series of antennae to interact with the RF signal   Erb says   Instead  we can put our boron nitride based material in and around an RF component and it is essentially invisible to the RF signal  The other improvement  says Erb  is that It can be form fit directly to the electrical component  Echo St  Germain  a fifth year mechanical engineering student at Northeastern who is serving as a ceramic researcher and R D engineer at Fourier  demonstrated the ceramic s non Newtonian behavior by subjecting a clumpy slurry of it to vibration that is normal to the manufacturing process  it instantly liquified and organized the structure of the material  Such slurries are used to produce the moldable ceramics Erb and Bice believe they ll be able to form fit the all ceramic materials to all kinds of electrical components  The ceramic will be thinner  lighter and more efficient than the metals currently in use Bice has helped launch the startup from Munich  where his wife has started a new job  Launching a company that is Boston based while I m in Germany adds some interesting complications to things but also opportunities   says Bice  who with Erb is engaging in customer
