 Students Studying in The United States F 1 Post Completion OPT 

 F 1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS for Post Completion Optional Practical Training OPT work authorization which helps them apply their classroom learning to the real world 









Post Completion Optional Practical Training Post OPT is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U S Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS It is available to eligible F 1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study A Post OPT application first requires an OPT recommendation on a student s Form I 20 then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication If successful USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document EAD 







 IMPORTANT Biometrics Appointments are NOT required for Post Completion OPT STEM Extension OPT I 765 Applications On July 12th the USCIS implemented a feature on I 765 applications called myProgress that will eventually allow OPT STEM applications to see more detail about their pending applications Unfortunately there is currently a glitch with this feature showing a biometrics appointment requirement Please note that you can disregard this as biometrics appointments are NOT required for I 765 applicants in the C03B and C03C eligibility categories for OPT STEM OPT Additionally the estimated processing times are NOT accurate as this is taking into account estimated times for all types of I 765 applications not just OPT STEM OPT

Important reminder about Your Program Completion Date The program end date on your I 20 is an estimated program end date which may be different from your actual program end date You must apply for OPT based on your last registered term For immigration purposes program completion date corresponds with the last term of enrollment not necessarily the date of the graduation ceremony or degree conferral date For example if you finish all of your courses in May but your degree conferral is in August your I 20 end date will be a May date if you have no registration over the summer PhD student Program Completion Dates Students in the PhD program may choose the date of completion based on any of the following dates 

Dissertation defense date or Dissertation correction submission date or End of last registered term





 Choosing Your Post OPT Start Date 

If you have not used any Pre Completion OPT time you may request up to 12 months of Post Completion OPT You must request a start date within the 60 day grace period of your program You select your own start and end date for OPT even if you do not yet have a job offer Here are some general suggestions to help you make the best decision for your situation 

If you have a job offer and your job starts during your 60 day grace period use the job start date or earlier as your requested start of OPT If you have a job offer and it starts after your 60 day grace period use the latest date possible 59th day of grace period for your OPT start date

 Reminder Students are not eligible to begin working until the Post OPT has been approved by USCIS they have received their EAD and the start date on the EAD has arrived

 Note for PhD Students 

If a PhD student has completed all their coursework but is in the final stages of thesis dissertation immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre Completion OPT or Post Completion OPT while completing their thesis dissertation In this case the PhD student and their college need to determine the end date of program completion and the student s I 20 will be updated to reflect it as the completion date of the program If you choose to apply for Post Completion OPT while completing thesis dissertation
