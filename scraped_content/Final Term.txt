 Students Studying in The United States Final term 

 In general F 1 and J 1 students are required to maintain full time enrollment even in their final academic term There is an exception which you can learn about below 











 Final term enrollment 

Some students do not have a full course load left to take in their final academic term because they have already taken most requirements Students in this situation are allowed to enroll in less than a full course load during their final term but the following criteria must be met 

Students must maintain appropriate on ground presence during their final term This means that they may not register for only online courses The only exception is for students who intend to finish their program online from overseas

Please refer also to the limitations on online course enrollment

 Students must enroll in all remaining courses needed to complete their academic program Students must maintain on ground presence throughout the entire final term via enrollment in on ground courses 

Students may not enroll in courses that only occur in the first session of the term and have no course enrollment in second session of the term



All students in their final term must notify OGS by submitting the Intent to Complete Program form within 30 days after the start of their final term This e form alerts OGS to shorten a student s I 20 DS 2019 if your end date occurs in a future term Remember your I 20 DS 2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment
